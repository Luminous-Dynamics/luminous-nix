## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Natural Conversations
```bash

🎯 Intent: install (confidence: 0.85)
📦 Installing firefox...

$ ask-nix "actually remove it"
📝 Resolved: 'it' → 'firefox'
🗑️ Removing firefox...

$ ask-nix "undo that"
⏪ Rolling back to previous generation...
✅ Successfully rolled back!
```

### Smart Error Recovery
```bash
$ ask-nix "install nonexistent-package"
❌ Package Not Found

The package 'nonexistent-package' couldn't be found.

Try:
• Searching for similar names: nix search nonexistent
• Checking the NixOS package search: https://search.nixos.org

Suggested fixes:
1. Search for similar package names
2. Update package channels
```

### Development Environments
```bash
$ ask-nix "create python development shell"
🛠️ Creating python development environment...
📦 Packages: python3 python3Packages.pip python3Packages.virtualenv
[nix-shell:~]$
```
