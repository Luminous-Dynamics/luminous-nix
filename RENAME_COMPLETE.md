## 🌊 The Philosophy

The rename from "Nix for Humanity" to "Luminous Nix" represents a evolution in understanding. Rather than trying to "fix" or "solve" something for humanity (which "nix" could imply rejecting), we're now illuminating and brightening the path - making the powerful NixOS system glow with accessibility and consciousness-first design.

This aligns perfectly with the broader Luminous Dynamics mission: creating technology that amplifies human consciousness rather than fragmenting it.

## 🙏 Gratitude

Thank you for recognizing the importance of naming and its impact on perception. This change removes a barrier to adoption and better represents the project's sacred mission of making powerful technology accessible to all beings through natural language and consciousness-first design.
