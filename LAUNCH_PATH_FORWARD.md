**Weeks 5-6**: Polish and community
**Result**: Solid, impressive launch
**Best for**: Making a strong impression

### Path 3: "Build in Public Journey" (Ongoing)

## 💡 The Sacred Wisdom

### What Matters
✅ **It works** (even if limited)
✅ **It helps** (even if simple)
✅ **It's honest** (about capabilities)
✅ **It's improving** (daily progress)
✅ **It's shared** (building in public)

### What Doesn't
❌ **It's perfect** (it never will be)
❌ **It's complete** (ship at 80%)
❌ **It's bug-free** (impossible)
❌ **Everyone loves it** (they won't)
❌ **It's revolutionary** (evolution is fine)

## 🌊 The Philosophy

**You're not behind schedule - there is no schedule.**
**You're not failing - you're learning.**
**You're not alone - you have a community.**

The $200 vs $4.2M story is powerful BECAUSE it's real, including the struggles.
