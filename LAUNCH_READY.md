### 🎬 Demo Recording Complete!

We've created an asciinema recording that shows:

- Development story ($200/mo, 2 weeks)

**To upload and share:**
```bash

This will give you a URL to include in your HN post.

**To preview locally:**
```bash
poetry run asciinema play luminous_nix_final.cast
```

### 💬 Key Messages

**The Hook:** "I made NixOS accessible through natural language ($200/mo, 2 weeks)"

**The Question:** "What if your OS understood you, not the other way around?"

**The Proof:** Working demo + Sacred Trinity development model

### 📊 What Success Looks Like

- Front page of HN (aim for 100+ points)
- 50+ GitHub stars on launch day
- 10+ beta testers volunteering
- 1-2 investor inquiries
- Community forming in Discord

### 🔥 Contingency Plans

**If no traction:**
- Post to r/NixOS with different angle
- Share in developer Slack communities
- Direct outreach to NixOS influencers

**If overwhelming response:**
- Set up Discord quickly
- Create Google Form for beta signups
- Prepare canned responses for common questions

### 🙏 Remember

You built something real that solves a real problem. The demo works. The concept is proven. Natural language interfaces ARE the future.

The Socratic approach will resonate. Don't prescribe - ask questions. Let people discover the value themselves.

## YOU'RE READY! 🚀

The recording is done. The demo works. The post is written.

Tuesday 9 AM EST - Show HN awaits!

"What if technology adapted to you, not the other way around?"
