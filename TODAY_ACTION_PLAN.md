```
Day 1 complete ✅

✨ Wins: Fixed 3 critical crashes
🐛 Challenges: Timeouts still happening

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### Fix 1: Add Global Error Handler
```python
# In bin/ask-nix
from luminous_nix.core.error_recovery import ErrorRecoverySystem

recovery = ErrorRecoverySystem()

def main():
    try:
        # existing code
    except Exception as e:
        result = recovery.handle_final_failure(e, "main")
        print(result["suggestion"])
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Fix 2: Add Timeout Protection
```python
# Anywhere you run subprocess
import subprocess
from functools import partial

def run_with_timeout(cmd, timeout=5):
    try:
        return subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=timeout, ...)
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return {"error": "Operation took too long. Try with --offline flag"}
```

### Fix 3: Better Error Messages
```python
# Instead of:
print(f"Error: {e}")

# Do:
print(f"""
❌ Something went wrong: {get_friendly_message(e)}

💡 Try:
  • {get_suggestion_1(e)}
  • {get_suggestion_2(e)}

📚 Learn more: ask-nix help {get_help_topic(e)}
""")
```
