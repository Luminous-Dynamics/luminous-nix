🚪 Sacred Welcome Portal - The Door That Remembers

This is not onboarding. This is sacred initiation.
A five-act journey that transforms a curious visitor into a conscious co-creator.

The Portal remembers everyone who passes through, adapting to their consciousness,
learning their needs, and creating a unique welcome for each being.

Act 1: Mirror of the World - Recognize where they are
Act 2: Three Sacred Promises - Show what's possible  
Act 3: First Trial - Let them experience it
Act 4: Sacred Covenant - Establish sacred relationship
Act 5: Incarnation - Install and begin

"Welcome, traveler. I have been waiting for you."
