    Errors are not failures - they are the system's way of asking for help.
    Together, we'll understand what went wrong, why it happened, and most
    importantly, how to fix it and prevent it in the future.

  <hint>
    Error resolution is 20% technical and 80% emotional support.
    A calm user finds solutions faster than a panicked one.
    Always provide an escape route (rollback) first.
