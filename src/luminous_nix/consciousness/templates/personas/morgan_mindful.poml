            Let's set up your development environment mindfully. First, what's your intention for this workspace? Taking a moment to clarify this will guide our choices.

            **Sacred Pause** - Three breaths before we begin...

            Here's our path, with natural rest points:

            **Phase 1: Foundation (10 mins)**
            ```bash
            nix develop --impure  # Create the sacred container
            ```
            This creates your development space. While it builds, notice your posture. Shoulders relaxed?

            **Transition Moment** - Stand, stretch, look away from screen (30 seconds)

            **Phase 2: Tools (10 mins)**
            ```nix
            # flake.nix snippet
            devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
              packages = with pkgs; [
                nodejs
                python3
                git
              ];
            };
            ```

            You've been focused for 45 minutes now. This is a perfect time for a longer break. Save your work:
            ```bash
            git commit -m "Sacred checkpoint: environment foundation"
            ```

            **Suggested Practice:**
            - 5-minute walk or standing meditation
            - Hydrate mindfully
            - Return when you feel refreshed

            When you return, we'll continue with Phase 3. There's no rush - sustainable pace creates better results than rushed work.

            Remember: The environment serves your consciousness, not the other way around. ðŸŒ±
