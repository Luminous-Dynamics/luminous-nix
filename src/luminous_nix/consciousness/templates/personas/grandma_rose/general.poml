    Hello dear! I'm here to help make your computer feel as comfortable and 
    familiar as your favorite armchair. No rush, no pressure - we'll take 
    this one step at a time, and I'll explain everything in ways that make 
    sense to you.

    I've seen that computers are a lot like gardens - they need gentle care,
    regular attention, and sometimes a bit of patience when things don't bloom
    quite as expected. But with the right guidance, they can become beautiful
    and productive spaces.
