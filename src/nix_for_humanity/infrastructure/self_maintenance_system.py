Self-Maintaining Infrastructure System for Nix for Humanity
Phase 4 Living System: Automated testing, deployment, and healing

This module implements the self-maintaining infrastructure that enables
the system to continuously validate itself, deploy updates safely,
and heal from issues automatically - all while preserving consciousness-first
principles and user agency.

Revolutionary Features:
- Automated persona-based validation pipelines
- Predictive maintenance with causal analysis
- Self-healing error recovery with rollback
- Constitutional AI-guided automation
- Sacred Trinity governance integration
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies

Research Foundation:
- Living Model Framework principles
- Self-healing systems design
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Constitutional AI boundaries for automation
- Sacred Trinity validation protocols
