Based on the file structure, the XAI system appears to implement:

1. **Causal Models** (models.py)
   - Decision structures
   - Explanation formats
   - Causal factors and relationships

2. **Knowledge Base** (knowledge_base.py)
   - Storage for causal models
   - Model retrieval and management

3. **Model Builder** (builder.py)
   - Constructs causal graphs
   - Defines relationships between factors

4. **Inference Engine** (inference.py)
   - Performs causal reasoning
   - Calculates effects and confidence

5. **Explanation Generator** (generator.py)
   - Creates human-readable explanations
   - Adapts to different personas

6. **Main Engine** (engine.py)
   - Orchestrates all components
   - Provides high-level API

The system uses a **causal graph approach** where:
- User actions are "treatments"
- System state are "confounders"
- Outcomes are the results

This allows for transparent "why" explanations by tracing
causal paths through the graph.
