## What Lives Here

These voice interface components represent the foundation for natural speech interaction with Luminous Nix. They were developed with care and represent significant progress toward making NixOS accessible through voice commands.

## Components Preserved

### Core Voice Infrastructure
- **voice_interface.py** - Main voice interface implementation
- **voice_interface_enhanced.py** - Advanced features and improvements
- **voice_connection.py** - WebSocket connection management
- **voice_requirements.txt** - Python dependencies for voice

### Backend Integration
- **voice_websocket_server.py** - WebSocket server for real-time voice
- **voice_nlp_integration.py** - Natural language processing for voice
- **voice_input_grandma_rose.py** - Persona-specific voice adaptations

### Testing & Examples
- **test_voice_simple.py** - Basic voice tests
- **test_complete_voice_pipeline.py** - End-to-end voice testing
- **voice_demo_simple.py** - Simple demonstration

### Configuration
- **voice.nix** - NixOS module for voice support
- **setup_voice.py** - Voice setup utility

## Why Preserved for v2.0

Voice interface adds significant complexity:
- Requires additional dependencies (Whisper, Piper)
- Needs real-time processing capabilities
- Increases testing surface area
- Requires careful accessibility considerations

For v1.0, we focus on rock-solid text-based interaction. Voice will enhance the experience in v2.0 when the core is proven stable.

## Integration Path

When ready for v2.0:
1. Restore voice components to main codebase
2. Update dependencies in pyproject.toml
3. Add voice feature flags
4. Implement progressive enhancement
5. Test with all 10 personas

## Technical Notes

- Uses pipecat for low-latency processing
- Whisper for speech-to-text
- Piper for text-to-speech
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Supports wake word detection
