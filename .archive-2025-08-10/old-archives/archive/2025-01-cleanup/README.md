# Archive from 2025-01-24 Cleanup

These directories were archived during project consolidation to focus on the web-based implementation as the primary development path.

## Why These Were Archived
- Duplicates of existing code
- Legacy implementations
- Over-engineered approaches that don't align with 'Ship Small, Ship Often'
- Desktop complexity when web-first serves our users better

All code is preserved here with gratitude for the learning it provided.
