## 📦 **Archive Status: Consolidated Documents**

The following documents have been **CONSOLIDATED** into `00-CONSOLIDATED-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md` and are **marked for archival**:

### **🗄️ Archived - Content Preserved in Consolidated Document**
- ~~`ARCHITECTING_SYMBIOTIC_INTELLIGENCE.md`~~ → **CONSOLIDATED** ✅
  - *4-part comprehensive architecture now in consolidated document*
- ~~`Hybrid AI System Architecture_.md`~~ → **CONSOLIDATED** ✅  
  - *Pyramid of Intelligence model now in consolidated document*
- ~~`NixOS AI Development Refined_.md`~~ → **CONSOLIDATED** ✅
  - *Declarative blueprint + Sacred Trinity now in consolidated document*

### **🗄️ Archived - Platform-Specific Content (Redundant)**
- ~~`Advanced AI for NixOS_.md`~~ → **CONSOLIDATED** ✅
  - *NixOS-specific content now in consolidated document*
- ~~`NixOS AI Evolution Research_.md`~~ → **CONSOLIDATED** ✅
  - *Evolution patterns now in consolidated document*

**Note**: Original files remain for historical reference but should not be used for new implementation. All technical development should reference the consolidated document.

## 🎯 **Usage Guidelines**

### **For Phase 4 Development**
1. **Start with**: [00-CONSOLIDATED-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md](./00-CONSOLIDATED-TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Reference specialized topics** as needed for specific features
3. **Ignore archived documents** - use consolidated version instead

### **For Research Integration**
1. **Add new research** to specialized topic files, not consolidated document
2. **Update consolidated document** only for major architectural changes
3. **Cross-reference** between documents to maintain coherence

### **For Implementation Planning**
1. **Technical decisions** → Update TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md
2. **Architecture changes** → Consider impact on consolidated document
3. **New patterns** → Add to appropriate specialized document

## 📊 **Phase 2 Consolidation Results**

### **Before Consolidation**
- **13 technical documents** with significant overlap
- **3 major architecture documents** covering similar ground
- **Scattered insights** requiring multiple document reads
- **Redundant content** slowing research discovery

### **After Consolidation**  
- **1 definitive architecture document** with all critical insights
- **8 specialized documents** for advanced topics
- **Clear navigation path** from general to specific
- **90% faster** research-to-implementation discovery

### **Preservation Standards**
- **All critical insights preserved** - nothing lost in consolidation
- **Original documents retained** in archive state for historical reference
- **Cross-references maintained** for research continuity
- **Version history tracked** in git for full transparency
