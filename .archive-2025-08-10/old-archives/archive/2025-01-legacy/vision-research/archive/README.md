# ðŸ“¦ Research Archive

This directory is reserved for:
- Previous versions of research documents
- Superseded analyses
- Historical documentation
- Work-in-progress drafts

## Purpose

As research evolves, we preserve earlier iterations here to:
1. Track the evolution of ideas
2. Maintain historical context
3. Reference previous approaches
4. Learn from past decisions

## Usage

Files are moved here when:
- A document is significantly revised
- Research direction changes
- Multiple documents are consolidated
- New frameworks replace old ones
