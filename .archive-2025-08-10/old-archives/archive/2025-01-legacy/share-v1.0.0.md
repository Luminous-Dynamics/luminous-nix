- 10x faster operations with native Python-Nix API

**What makes it special:**
- Built for $200/month instead of $4.2M

# Luminous Nix v1.0.0 Released - Natural Language Interface for NixOS

Hi NixOS Community!

I'm thrilled to announce the first stable release of Luminous Nix - a natural language interface that makes NixOS accessible to everyone.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language CLI**: Just say what you want
- **Configuration Generation**: Describe your system, get a configuration.nix
- **Smart Discovery**: Find packages by what they do, not their names
- **Lightning Fast**: Native Python-Nix API integration (10x-100x faster)

## Philosophy
We believe NixOS's power shouldn't require memorizing commands. Built using our Sacred Trinity development model (Human + AI collaboration), proving that revolutionary software can be built for $200/month instead of millions.

## Try It Out
```
nix run github:Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix
ask-nix "help me set up a web server"
```

We'd love your feedback as we continue development. v1.1 with TUI and voice interface coming soon!

Release: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix/releases/tag/v1.0.0
