# 🧪 Test Coverage Enhancement Plan for Luminous Nix

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Coverage Metrics
- **Overall Coverage**: 56.72% (Target: 95%+)
- **Critical Gaps**: CLI Adapter (0%), TUI (0%)
- **Strong Areas**: Core Engine (91%), Knowledge Base (94%)

## 🎯 Enhancement Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests (Week 1)
Priority: Restore disconnected test coverage

#### 1.1 CLI Adapter Coverage
- **Current**: 0% coverage despite existing tests
- **Issue**: Test imports not reaching source code
- **Actions**:
  ```bash
  # Fix import paths in test files
  # Update test_cli_adapter_comprehensive.py
  # Ensure proper mocking of subprocess calls
  # Add integration tests for all CLI commands
  ```

#### 1.2 TUI Test Activation
- **Current**: Comprehensive tests exist but 0% execution
- **Issue**: Textual framework mocking not working
- **Actions**:
  ```bash
  # Configure Textual test runner properly
  # Mock UI components for headless testing
  # Enable async test execution
  # Test all user interaction flows
  ```

### Phase 2: New Test Creation (Week 2)

#### 2.1 CLI Adapter Unit Tests
```python
# Priority test cases:
- Command parsing (natural language → intent)
- Error handling and educational messages
- Configuration management
- Output formatting
- Subprocess execution mocking
```

#### 2.2 TUI Component Tests
```python
# Priority test cases:
- Screen navigation
- Form input validation
- Real-time updates
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Accessibility features
```

#### 2.3 Voice Interface Integration
```python
# Priority test cases:
- Wake word detection accuracy
- Speech-to-text pipeline
- Command interpretation
- TTS output generation
- Error recovery flows
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Week 3)

#### 3.1 End-to-End Scenarios
```yaml
Critical User Journeys:
  - First-time user installation
  - Package search and install
  - Configuration generation
  - Error education flow
  - Learning system adaptation
```

#### 3.2 Performance Testing
```yaml
Performance Benchmarks:
  - Command execution < 0.5s
  - Natural language parsing < 100ms
  - TUI responsiveness < 50ms
  - Memory usage < 100MB
```

### Phase 4: Continuous Integration (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Automated Coverage Reporting
```yaml
CI Pipeline:
  - Run tests on every PR
  - Block merge if coverage drops
  - Generate coverage badges
  - Trend analysis reports
```

#### 4.2 Test Quality Metrics
```yaml
Quality Checks:
  - Test execution time
  - Flaky test detection
  - Mock usage analysis
  - Coverage trend tracking
```

## 📈 Coverage Targets by Module

| Module | Current | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Final |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| CLI Adapter | 0% | 60% | 85% | 95% | 95%+ |
| TUI | 0% | 50% | 80% | 90% | 95%+ |
| Core Engine | 91% | 91% | 95% | 95% | 98%+ |
| Knowledge Base | 94% | 94% | 95% | 98% | 98%+ |
| Voice Interface | 70% | 75% | 85% | 90% | 95%+ |
| **Overall** | **56.72%** | **75%** | **85%** | **92%** | **95%+** |

## 🛠️ Implementation Tools

### Testing Frameworks
- **pytest**: Primary test runner
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support
- **textual-dev**: TUI testing tools
- **pytest-mock**: Enhanced mocking

### Mocking Strategy
```python
# Key mocks needed:
- subprocess.run() for NixOS commands
- Audio devices for voice interface
- Textual UI components
- File system operations
- Network requests
```

## 📋 Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (60% of tests)
- Pure functions
- Class methods
- Error handling
- Data validation

### 2. Integration Tests (30% of tests)
- Module interactions
- API contracts
- Database operations
- External service calls

### 3. E2E Tests (10% of tests)
- Complete user flows
- Real NixOS commands (sandboxed)
- Performance validation
- Accessibility verification

## ✅ Success Criteria

1. **Coverage**: All modules ≥ 95% line coverage
2. **Performance**: All tests run in < 5 minutes
3. **Reliability**: Zero flaky tests
4. **Maintainability**: Clear test naming and structure
5. **Documentation**: Test purpose clearly documented

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=nix_humanity --cov-report=html

# Run specific module tests
pytest tests/cli/ -v
pytest tests/tui/ -v

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=nix_humanity --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run with parallel execution
pytest -n auto
```

## 📊 Monitoring Progress

Weekly coverage reports will be generated and tracked:
- Coverage trends by module
- New test effectiveness
- Performance impact analysis
- Flaky test identification

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix existing test import issues (Day 1-2)
2. Create missing CLI adapter tests (Day 3-5)
3. Enable TUI test execution (Day 6-8)
4. Add integration test suite (Day 9-12)
5. Setup CI/CD automation (Day 13-15)
