# v1.0.0 File Structure Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### ✅ Root Directory Cleanup
- **Before**: 20+ loose files cluttering the root
- **After**: Only 9 essential files remain
- **Moved**: Development scripts, test reports, journals to appropriate directories

### ✅ Directory Organization
```
Created:
- docs/archive/development-journals/  (6 files moved)
- docs/archive/test-reports/         (5 files moved)  
- docs/archive/status-history/       (50+ files moved)
- data/databases/                    (1 file moved)

Removed:
- backend-primary (broken symlink)
- frontend-primary (broken symlink)
```

### ✅ Files Archived
- Development journals: TESTING_JOURNAL.md, WEEK3_*.md, etc.
- Test reports: v1_comprehensive_test_report.md, etc.
- Fix scripts: Moved to scripts/
- Documentation drafts: DOCUMENTATION_*.md files
