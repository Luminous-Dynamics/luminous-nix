## Date: 2025-08-09 (Example Entry)

### What I Tried
- `./bin/ask-nix "install brave browser"`

### What Happened
- Error: "Package 'brave browser' not found. Did you mean 'brave'?"
- Had to try again with exact package name

### What I Expected
- It should understand "brave browser" means the "brave" package
- Natural language should be... natural

### Frustration Level: 6/10
- Made me think about exact package names, defeating the purpose

### Would a New User Understand?
- [ ] Yes
- [X] No, because: They wouldn't know to try just "brave"

### Did I Give Up and Use Regular Commands?
- [ ] Yes, after 2 minutes
- [X] No (but was tempted)

### Missing Feature Discovered
- Fuzzy package name matching
- Common aliases (firefox browser â†’ firefox)

### Bug or Design Flaw?
- Design flaw: Too literal interpretation of package names
