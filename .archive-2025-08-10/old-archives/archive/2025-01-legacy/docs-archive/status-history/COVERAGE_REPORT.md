# 📊 Test Coverage Report - Luminous Nix

*Generated: 2025-08-01 07:59:23*

## Executive Summary

- **Current Coverage**: 62.3%
- **Target Coverage**: 95.0%
- **Gap to Target**: 32.7%
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

## Testing Foundation Progress

Our Testing Foundation initiative aims to solidify the codebase with 95% test coverage. Here's our current progress:

### ✅ Completed Milestones
- [x] Performance Regression Tests (Native Python-Nix Interface validation)
- [x] Persona-based E2E Tests (All 10 personas validated)
- [x] Security Boundary Tests (17 tests, 6 issues identified)
- [x] Coverage Monitoring Infrastructure (Automated reporting)

### 🚧 In Progress  
- [ ] Unit Test Coverage Improvements
- [ ] Integration Test Expansion
- [ ] Critical Path Test Coverage

## Coverage Breakdown

### Files Needing Attention
- **src/cli_adapter.py**: 0.0% (156 lines missing)
- **src/nlp_engine.py**: 45.2% (87 lines missing)

### Testing Strategy

Our approach follows the testing pyramid:
- **60% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated component testing
- **30% Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation  
- **10% E2E Tests**: Complete user journey validation

### Quality Gates

- ✅ **Security**: 17 security boundary tests implemented
- ✅ **Performance**: Native API performance regression tests
- ✅ **Accessibility**: 10-persona validation tests
- ✅ **Privacy**: Local-first data protection tests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Address files with <50% coverage
2. **Integration Focus**: Expand CLI ↔ Backend communication tests  
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Add error condition and boundary tests
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated coverage regression detection

## Sacred Principles

Every test is written with consciousness-first principles:
- Tests serve as documentation for future developers
- Coverage serves users, not just metrics
- Quality over quantity in test design
- Testing as an act of compassion for maintainers
