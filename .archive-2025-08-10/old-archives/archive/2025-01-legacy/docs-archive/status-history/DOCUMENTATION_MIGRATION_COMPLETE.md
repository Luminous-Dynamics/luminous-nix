## Final Documentation Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-VISION/           # Vision and research
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-ARCHITECTURE/     # Technical architecture
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-DEVELOPMENT/      # Development guides
â”œâ”€â”€ 04-OPERATIONS/       # Operational documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ 05-REFERENCE/        # API and reference docs
â”œâ”€â”€ 06-TUTORIALS/        # User tutorials
â”œâ”€â”€ ARCHIVE/             # Historical documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ACTIVE_20250729_143712.tar.gz  # Today's archive
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ completed/       # Completed plans
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ historical/      # Historical docs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ old-versions/    # Previous versions
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Main documentation index
â””â”€â”€ [other docs]         # Supporting documentation
```

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Numbering**: Sequential organization from vision to operations
2. **Clean Hierarchy**: No more mixed ACTIVE/VISION/ARCHIVE confusion
3. **Easy Navigation**: Numbered folders show clear progression
4. **Preserved History**: All legacy docs safely archived with timestamps
5. **Updated References**: All cross-references now point to correct locations

## Next Steps

- The documentation is now properly organized and ready for use
- All paths in CLAUDE.md have been updated to reflect the new structure
- The legacy ACTIVE directory is preserved in the archive for reference
- The system is ready for continued development with a clean documentation structure
