# Poetry2nix Migration Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated Luminous Nix from pip/requirements.txt to Poetry for proper NixOS compatibility through poetry2nix.

## What Changed

### 1. pyproject.toml Conversion
- **From**: setuptools/PEP 621 format
- **To**: Poetry format with proper build system
- **Dependencies**: Integrated from 3 requirements.txt files
- **Extras**: Created groups for optional features (tui, voice, web, ml, advanced)

### 2. Files Removed
- `requirements.txt` - Main dependencies
- `requirements-tui.txt` - TUI dependencies  
- `scripts/requirements.txt` - Script dependencies

### 3. Key Dependency Fixes
- `types-blessed` → Removed (doesn't exist on PyPI)
- `pytest-textual` → Removed (doesn't exist on PyPI)
- `espeak-ng` → `py-espeak-ng` (correct package name)
- `py-nix-eval` → Removed (doesn't exist on PyPI)
- `dowhy` → Made conditional for Python <3.12

### 4. Poetry Lock Generated
Successfully generated `poetry.lock` with all dependencies resolved.

## Using the New Setup

### Development Environment
```bash
# Enter nix shell with poetry2nix
nix develop

# Or use nix-shell
nix-shell

# Poetry commands are now available
poetry install
poetry run python script.py
```

### Why Poetry2nix?

On NixOS, you cannot use pip to install system packages due to the immutable /nix/store filesystem. Poetry2nix solves this by:
1. Converting Poetry dependencies to Nix expressions
2. Building a pure, reproducible Python environment
3. Integrating seamlessly with NixOS package management

## Technology Review

See `POETRY_MIGRATION_AND_TECH_REVIEW.md` for:
- Alternatives to dowhy for Python 3.12+ support
- Modern replacements for other dependencies
- Performance and feature improvements

## Next Steps

1. Test the poetry2nix environment thoroughly
2. Consider replacing dowhy with pgmpy for broader Python support
3. Implement suggested dependency improvements from tech review
4. Update CI/CD to use Poetry instead of pip
