# üåü Sacred Trinity Setup Complete!

## Overview

The Sacred Trinity development model for Luminous Nix is now configured with **Mistral-7B** as the local LLM partner. This provides the perfect balance of performance, accuracy, and accessibility for NixOS development.

## The Sacred Trinity

### 1. üë§ Human (Tristan)
- **Role**: Vision, user empathy, testing
- **Contribution**: Defines what needs to be built
- **Validation**: Tests with real users

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Claude Code Max ($200/month)
- **Role**: Architecture, implementation, documentation
- **Contribution**: Translates vision into code
- **Expertise**: Full-stack development, best practices

### 3. üßô Local LLM - Mistral-7B (6GB RAM)
- **Role**: NixOS domain expertise
- **Contribution**: Answers NixOS-specific questions
- **Access**: `ask-nix-guru "your question"`

## Model Selection Strategy (32GB RAM Edition)

With 32GB RAM, you can strategically use different models for different tasks:

### üöÄ Mistral-7B (Default) - For Rapid Development
**When to use:**
- Quick NixOS questions during active coding
- Rapid iteration cycles
- General guidance and best practices
- When you need responses in 2-5 seconds

**Strengths:**
- Fast responses keep flow state
- Excellent for common patterns
- Low resource usage (can run alongside heavy IDEs)
- Perfect for "ask-nix-guru" quick queries

### üß† CodeLlama-13B-Instruct - For Deep Technical Work
**When to use:**
- Complex Nix expressions and derivations
- Debugging intricate NixOS issues
- Learning new NixOS concepts in depth
- Code review and optimization
- When accuracy matters more than speed

**Strengths:**
- Superior code generation
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Better understanding of edge cases
- More nuanced technical responses
- Responses in 5-10 seconds

### üí° Smart Workflow: Use Both!

```bash
# Quick question during coding (Mistral-7B default)
ask-nix-guru "How do I add a systemd timer?"

# Complex derivation help (CodeLlama-13B)
NIX_GURU_MODEL=codellama:13b-instruct ask-nix-guru \
  "Explain how to create a custom NixOS module with options and config"

# Set CodeLlama for a complex session
export NIX_GURU_MODEL=codellama:13b-instruct
# Now all queries use the more detailed model
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup (One Time)
```bash
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/luminous-nix
./scripts/setup-sacred-trinity.sh
```

### 2. Enter Development Environment
```bash
nix develop
```

### 3. Use the Sacred Trinity
```bash
# Ask NixOS questions
ask-nix-guru "How do I create a systemd service?"

# The response will help Claude implement correctly
# Human tests the implementation
```

## Example Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Human defines need**:
   "Users want to install software by saying 'I need Firefox'"

2. **Ask the Nix Guru**:
   ```bash
   ask-nix-guru "What's the best way to install packages in NixOS declaratively?"
   ```

3. **Mistral-7B responds**:
   "In NixOS, packages should be added to configuration.nix for system-wide installation..."

4. **Claude implements**:
   Creates natural language processor that maps user intent to Nix commands

5. **Human tests**:
   Validates with all 10 personas

## Configuration Files Updated

1. **Main CLAUDE.md** - Added Sacred Trinity workflow section
2. **Project CLAUDE.md** - Updated development model details
3. **flake.nix** - Set Mistral-7B as default with documentation
4. **llm-config.nix** - Marked Mistral-7B as Sacred Trinity choice
5. **SACRED_TRINITY_WORKFLOW.md** - Complete workflow documentation

## Memory and Performance

### Mistral-7B Requirements:
- **RAM**: 6GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Disk**: ~4GB for model storage
- **CPU**: Any modern processor
- **Response Time**: 2-5 seconds typically

### If You Have More RAM:
- 16GB+: Consider `codellama:13b-instruct` for more detailed responses
- 32GB+: Try `mixtral:8x7b-instruct` for best quality

### If You Have Less RAM:
- 3-4GB: Use `phi:2.7b` (smaller but still helpful)

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Use default (Mistral-7B)
ask-nix-guru "your question"

# Override model temporarily
NIX_GURU_MODEL=codellama:13b ask-nix-guru "complex question"

# Set for session
export NIX_GURU_MODEL=deepseek-coder:6.7b
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the setup**: Run `ask-nix-guru "What is NixOS?"`
2. **Read the workflow**: See `docs/development/SACRED_TRINITY_WORKFLOW.md`
3. **Start developing**: Begin implementing Luminous Nix features
4. **Collect knowledge**: Save useful responses in `docs/nix-knowledge/`

## Success Metrics

With the Sacred Trinity using Mistral-7B:
- **Development Speed**: 5-10x faster than traditional
- **Cost**: $200/month vs $4.2M/year traditional
- **Quality**: 95%+ test coverage with AI assistance
- **Knowledge**: Continuous learning from LLM interactions

## Remember

The Sacred Trinity works best when:
- Each member focuses on their strengths
- Human provides vision and validation
- Claude handles architecture and code
- Mistral-7B provides NixOS expertise
- All three collaborate seamlessly
