# 📋 Documentation Action Plan

## Current Status: ✅ Well Organized

Our documentation is in good shape overall, but we need to address a few key items to ensure clarity going forward.

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Update Core Documents for Adaptive Personality
- [x] Update **VISION.md** to emphasize adaptive personality over fixed mantras ✅
- [x] Update **ROADMAP_SACRED.md** to make mantras optional ✅
- [x] Create **ADAPTIVE_PERSONALITY.md** ✅ (Done)
- [x] Create **PERSONALITY_STYLES.md** ✅ (Done)
- [ ] Update sacred-executor.js to support personality styles

### 2. Consolidate Duplicate Documents
We have multiple versions of key documents that need consolidation:

#### Roadmaps (Choose one primary):
- `ROADMAP.md` - Original 3-month plan
- `ROADMAP_SACRED.md` - Sacred version with mantras
- `ROADMAP_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Comparison document

**Action**: Make ROADMAP.md the primary, incorporate improvements, make sacred elements optional ✅ (Done)

#### Vision Documents:
- Multiple vision files exist across directories
- Need one authoritative VISION.md

**Action**: Ensure docs/project/VISION.md is the single source of truth

### 3. Documentation Gaps to Fill
- [x] **PERSONALITY_STYLES.md** - Document the 5 personality styles ✅
- [x] **QUICK_START.md** - 5-minute getting started guide ✅
- [ ] **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - For users coming from CLI
- [ ] **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - How to test the adaptive patterns

## 📁 Current Documentation Structure (Good)

## ✨ Key Philosophy Update

### From:
"Every command includes a sacred mantra"

### To:
"Every command adapts to your preferred style - minimal, friendly, encouraging, sacred, or playful"

This change should be reflected across:
- Vision documents
- User guides
- Code implementation
- Marketing materials
