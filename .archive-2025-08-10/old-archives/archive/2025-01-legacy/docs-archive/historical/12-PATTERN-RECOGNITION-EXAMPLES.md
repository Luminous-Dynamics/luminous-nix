# 🎯 Pattern Recognition Examples

## How Luminous Nix Learns You

### 1. 📅 Temporal Patterns

#### The Sunday Updater
```python
# Pattern detected after 3 weeks
user_pattern = {
    "action": "system_update",
    "day": "Sunday",
    "time_range": "20:00-22:00",
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "confidence": 0.95
}

# System adaptation
if is_sunday_evening():
    suggest("🔄 It's Sunday evening. Ready for your weekly update?")
```

#### The Morning Developer
```python
# Pattern: Dev tools in morning, media in evening
patterns = {
    "06:00-12:00": ["vim", "git", "nodejs", "docker"],
    "18:00-23:00": ["spotify", "vlc", "discord", "steam"]
}

# Contextual suggestions
if current_time.hour < 12:
    priorities = ["development", "productivity"]
else:
    priorities = ["entertainment", "communication"]
```

### 2. 🗣️ Language Evolution Patterns

#### Progressive Abbreviation
```
Week 1: "Can you please install Firefox for me?"
Week 2: "install firefox"
Week 3: "inst firefox"
Week 4: "i firefox"
Week 5: "firefox"
System learns: "firefox" alone = install intent (for this user)
```

#### Personal Vocabulary
```python
user_aliases = {
    "grab": "install",
    "yeet": "remove",
    "check": "search",
    "fix": "update",
    "borked": "broken"
}

# Example interaction
User: "grab me some python"
System: "Installing python311 for you!"
```

### 3. 🔄 Workflow Patterns

#### The Web Developer Flow
```python
# Detected sequence pattern
workflow = {
    "name": "web_dev_setup",
    "sequence": [
        "install nodejs",
        "install yarn",
        "install postgresql",
        "start postgresql",
        "install vscode"
    ],
    "occurrence": 4,
    "contexts": ["new project", "monday morning"]
}

# Proactive suggestion
User: "install nodejs"
System: "Starting web dev setup? I can install nodejs, yarn, postgresql, and vscode together."
```

#### The Security Conscious
```python
# Pattern: Always checks before installing
security_pattern = {
    "sequence": [
        ("search", "package_name"),
        ("info", "package_name"),
        ("check", "dependencies"),
        ("install", "package_name")
    ],
    "consistency": 0.92
}

# Adapted behavior
User: "install unknown-package"
System: "Would you like to check package info first? (your usual preference)"
```

### 4. 🎨 Personality Preference Patterns

#### Style Migration
```python
# User gradually prefers less verbosity
personality_evolution = [
    ("Week 1", "encouraging", 0.8),
    ("Week 2", "friendly", 0.6),
    ("Week 3", "minimal", 0.4),
    ("Week 4", "minimal", 0.9)
]

# System adapts automatically
current_style = interpolate_style(personality_evolution)
```

#### Context-Sensitive Personality
```python
context_personality = {
    "morning": "minimal",        # Quick and efficient
    "errors": "encouraging",     # Patient and helpful
    "learning": "technical",     # Detailed explanations
    "friday_evening": "playful"  # Relaxed mood
}
```

### 5. 🔧 Problem-Solution Patterns

#### The WiFi Debugger
```python
# User's successful WiFi fix pattern
wifi_fix_pattern = {
    "problem": "wifi_not_working",
    "successful_sequence": [
        "systemctl status NetworkManager",
        "nmcli device wifi list",
        "systemctl restart NetworkManager"
    ],
    "success_rate": 1.0
}

# Next time:
User: "wifi broken again"
System: "Let me try your usual fix: restarting NetworkManager..."
```

#### Package Preferences
```python
# Learns specific package choices
package_preferences = {
    "browser": "firefox",         # not chrome
    "editor": "neovim",          # not vim or emacs
    "terminal": "alacritty",     # not kitty
    "shell": "zsh",              # not bash
    "python": "python311"        # specific version
}

User: "i need a browser"
System: "Installing Firefox (your preferred browser)..."
```

### 6. 📊 Error Recovery Patterns

#### The Typo Maker
```python
# Common typos for this user
typo_patterns = {
    "fierfix": "firefox",
    "pytohn": "python",
    "instal": "install",
    "updaet": "update"
}

User: "instal fierfix"
System: "Installing firefox..." # Auto-corrects without mentioning
```

#### Learning from Mistakes
```python
# User often forgets sudo
mistake_pattern = {
    "error": "permission_denied",
    "context": "system_modification",
    "frequency": 0.7,
    "solution": "add_sudo"
}

# Proactive prevention
User: "edit system config"
System: "I'll use sudo for this (requires admin privileges)"
```

### 7. 🎯 Goal Inference Patterns

#### The Project Starter
```python
# Detects new project patterns
project_patterns = {
    "rust_project": ["cargo", "rustc", "rust-analyzer"],
    "web_project": ["nodejs", "yarn", "webpack"],
    "data_science": ["python", "jupyter", "pandas", "numpy"],
    "game_dev": ["godot", "blender", "audacity"]
}

# Infers intent
User: "install cargo"
System: "Starting a Rust project? I can set up the complete Rust development environment."
```

#### The Learner
```python
# Detects learning patterns
learning_indicators = {
    "questions": ["how", "why", "what is"],
    "exploration": ["search", "info", "list"],
    "progression": ["basic", "intermediate", "advanced"]
}

# Adjusts explanations
User: "how does nix-env work?"
System: *Provides detailed explanation with examples*
       "Would you like to learn about Nix profiles next?"
```

### 8. 🌟 Advanced Pattern Recognition

#### Emotional State Inference
```python
# Detects frustration patterns
frustration_signals = {
    "rapid_commands": 5,  # commands in 30 seconds
    "repeated_errors": True,
    "language": ["broken", "stupid", "why", "ugh"],
    "time": "late_night"
}

# Compassionate response
System: "I notice you're having trouble. Let's take this step by step.
         Maybe a quick break would help? ☕"
```

#### Skill Progression
```python
# Tracks user growth
skill_progression = {
    "week_1": ["install", "remove", "search"],
    "week_4": ["generations", "rollback", "profiles"],
    "week_8": ["overlays", "flakes", "custom_packages"],
    "week_12": ["nixos_modules", "configuration.nix"]
}

# Celebrates milestones
System: "🎉 You just used your first flake! You've come so far!"
```

### 9. 🔮 Predictive Patterns

#### Pre-emptive Solutions
```python
# Predicts needs before they're expressed
predictive_model = {
    "after_nodejs": ["npm", "yarn"],         # 85% probability
    "after_python": ["pip", "virtualenv"],   # 78% probability
    "after_docker": ["docker-compose"],      # 92% probability
    "friday_evening": ["steam", "discord"]   # 73% probability
}

User: "install nodejs"
System: "Installing nodejs... Would you also like npm and yarn?"
```

#### System Maintenance Prediction
```python
# Predicts when user will want to update
update_prediction = {
    "average_interval": 7.2,  # days
    "preferred_day": "Sunday",
    "preferred_time": "20:30",
    "last_update": 6  # days ago
}

# Gentle reminder
System: "🔄 It's been a week since your last update. 
         Ready for your Sunday evening update?"
```

### 10. 🌈 Holistic User Understanding

#### Complete User Profile Evolution
```python
user_evolution = {
    "month_1": {
        "level": "beginner",
        "personality": "encouraging",
        "speed": "slow",
        "confidence": 0.3
    },
    "month_3": {
        "level": "intermediate", 
        "personality": "friendly",
        "speed": "moderate",
        "confidence": 0.7
    },
    "month_6": {
        "level": "advanced",
        "personality": "minimal",
        "speed": "fast",
        "confidence": 0.95
    }
}

# System evolves with user
adapt_interface_to_user(user_evolution)
```

## The Learning Never Stops

Each interaction teaches the system:
- New abbreviations
- Preferred workflows
- Optimal timing
- Emotional patterns
- Growth trajectories

The goal: Become so attuned to the user that the interface disappears, leaving only pure intention → action.
