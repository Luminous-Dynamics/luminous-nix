# üéØ Focused Roadmap - Luminous Nix v1.0

*From sprawling vision to laser-focused execution*

## üèÜ The Hero Capabilities

We're building TWO things exceptionally well:

### 1. **Lightning-Fast Native Nix Operations**
Transform `ask-nix "install firefox"` from a 5-second subprocess call to a 0.1-second native operation.

### 2. **Smart Learning Loop**
The assistant learns what you do and helps you do it better next time.

## üìÖ 6-Week Sprint to v1.0

### Week 1: Ruthless Simplification (Jan 13-19)
**Goal**: Clean slate with only essential code

#### Monday-Tuesday: The Great Cleanup
- [ ] Archive research documents (don't delete)
- [ ] Remove voice interface code
- [ ] Remove federated learning code  
- [ ] Remove Theory of Mind components
- [ ] Consolidate 10 personas ‚Üí 3 styles

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Code Consolidation
- [ ] Merge scattered Python files
- [ ] Create single `backend/core/` with 3 files
- [ ] Simplify directory structure
- [ ] Remove all mock tests

#### Friday: Documentation Reset
- [ ] Rewrite README (1 page, what works)
- [ ] Create QUICKSTART (5-minute guide)
- [ ] Archive 200+ pages of vision docs
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING for new focus

**Deliverable**: Clean codebase with ~80% less complexity

### Week 2-3: Native API Excellence (Jan 20 - Feb 2)
**Goal**: Make Native Python-Nix API production-ready

#### Week 2: Core Integration
- [ ] Complete nixos_rebuild integration
- [ ] Implement all package operations
- [ ] Add real progress indicators
- [ ] Handle subprocess fallbacks gracefully

```python
# Target API simplicity
from nix_humanity import NixOS

nix = NixOS()
nix.install("firefox")  # <0.1s, with progress
nix.update_system()     # <0.5s, no timeouts
nix.search("editor")    # <0.1s, native speed
```

#### Week 3: Edge Cases & Polish
- [ ] Error handling for all operations
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [ ] Rollback capability
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Integration tests (real, not mocks)

**Deliverable**: 10x-100x performance improvement, 99% reliability

### Week 4-5: Learning Loop (Feb 3-16)
**Goal**: Simple but effective learning from user behavior

#### Week 4: Pattern Tracking
- [ ] Track command success/failure
- [ ] Store command history efficiently
- [ ] Identify usage patterns
- [ ] Build suggestion engine

```python
# Learning in action
> ask-nix "install neovim"
‚úì Installing neovim... done!
üìù I noticed you often install dev tools. Would you like to see other popular editors?

> ask-nix "update"
‚úì Updating system...
üí° Based on your pattern, you usually garbage collect after updates. Run 'gc' next?
```

#### Week 5: Feedback Integration
- [ ] Learn from corrections
- [ ] Improve suggestions over time
- [ ] Show learning progress to user
- [ ] Personalize responses based on skill level

**Deliverable**: Visibly smarter after 10 interactions

### Week 6: Polish & Release (Feb 17-23)
**Goal**: Production-ready v1.0

#### Monday-Tuesday: Bug Bash
- [ ] Fix all critical bugs
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Memory usage check
- [ ] Security audit

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Documentation
- [ ] Update all docs to reflect reality
- [ ] Create demo video
- [ ] Write announcement post
- [ ] Prepare GitHub release

#### Friday: Release!
- [ ] Tag v1.0
- [ ] Publish to GitHub
- [ ] Announce to NixOS community
- [ ] Open for feedback

**Deliverable**: Luminous Nix v1.0 üéâ

## üéØ What Success Looks Like

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Performance**: All operations <0.5s (currently 2-5s)
- **Accuracy**: 95% intent recognition on top 20 commands
- **Reliability**: Zero crashes in normal usage
- **Learning**: Measurable improvement after 10 uses

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Reaction**: "Wow, this actually works!"
- **NixOS Community**: "Finally, what we needed"
- **Contributor Interest**: PRs start flowing
- **Our Feeling**: Pride in shipping quality

## üö´ What We're NOT Doing

### Not in v1.0
- ‚ùå Voice interfaces
- ‚ùå GUI/TUI beyond CLI
- ‚ùå Complex AI reasoning
- ‚ùå Distributed systems
- ‚ùå 10 personas (just 3)
- ‚ùå Federated learning
- ‚ùå Theory of Mind
- ‚ùå Consciousness fields
- ‚ùå Sacred computing philosophy in UI

### Deferred to Future
- **v1.1**: Beautiful TUI with Textual
- **v1.2**: Voice interface basics
- **v2.0**: Advanced learning & reasoning
- **v3.0**: Community features
- **vFuture**: Research concepts

## üìä Resource Allocation

### Development Time (6 weeks)
- **Week 1**: 100% cleanup/simplification
- **Week 2-3**: 80% Native API, 20% testing
- **Week 4-5**: 80% Learning Loop, 20% testing
- **Week 6**: 50% bugs, 50% polish/docs

### Focus Areas
- **Core Functionality**: 70%
- **Testing**: 20%
- **Documentation**: 10%

### What Gets Cut When Behind
1. First: Advanced learning features
2. Then: Suggestion engine sophistication
3. Then: Performance optimizations
4. Never: Core Native API functionality
5. Never: Basic command recognition

## üèÉ Sprint Cadence

### Daily
- Morning: Check focus, avoid feature creep
- Coding: One feature at a time
- Evening: Test what was built

### Weekly
- Monday: Week planning, goal clarity
- Friday: Demo progress, adjust plan
- Weekend: Rest (sustainable pace)

### Milestones
- **Week 1 End**: Codebase simplified
- **Week 3 End**: Native API complete
- **Week 5 End**: Learning loop working
- **Week 6 End**: v1.0 shipped!

## üéØ Risk Mitigation

### Biggest Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: Solved by this focused plan
2. **Over-Engineering**: Solved by simplicity mandate
3. **Native API Complexity**: Mitigated by 2-week allocation
4. **Learning Too Ambitious**: Keep it simple
5. **Documentation Scope**: 4 files only

### If Things Go Wrong
- **Behind Schedule**: Cut learning sophistication, not core API
- **Technical Blockers**: Use subprocess fallback
- **Complexity Returns**: Re-read this document
- **Feature Requests**: Add to v1.1 backlog
- **Burnout Risk**: Remember sustainable pace

## üìà Post-Launch Plan

### Week 7-8: Feedback Integration
- Gather user feedback
- Fix critical bugs
- Plan v1.1 based on real usage

### Month 3-4: Feature Addition
- Add most requested features
- Expand documentation
- Build contributor community

### Month 5-6: Scale Up
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced features
- Community integrations

## üí° Core Principles

### Technical Principles
1. **Simple > Complex**: Every time
2. **Working > Perfect**: Ship iteratively  
3. **Fast > Feature-Rich**: Speed matters
4. **Reliable > Clever**: Boring is good
5. **Local > Distributed**: No network deps

### Development Principles
1. **One thing at a time**
2. **Test with real commands**
3. **Document what exists**
4. **Fix before adding**
5. **Ship when ready, not perfect**

## üöÄ The Promise

In 6 weeks, we'll have:
- ‚úÖ Native Nix operations that are lightning fast
- ‚úÖ A learning assistant that actually helps
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ Honest, helpful documentation
- ‚úÖ Foundation for future growth

What we won't have:
- ‚ùå 50 half-built features
- ‚ùå Complex abstractions
- ‚ùå Unrealistic promises
- ‚ùå Technical debt
- ‚ùå Confused users

## üì¢ The Announcement (Week 6)

> "Luminous Nix v1.0: Natural language for NixOS that actually works.
> 
> Two features, done right:
> - Lightning-fast native operations (10x-100x speedup)
> - Smart learning that improves with use
> 
> Install with: `nix-shell -p nix-humanity`
> Try it: `ask-nix "install firefox"`
> 
> It's not everything we dreamed of. It's something better: it works."
