# Launch Strategy - Luminous Nix

## Strategic Decision: Build First, Launch with Impact

### Core Principle
**"Documentation is ready, but users need to see it work"**

A demo video of Grandma Rose installing software by voice will do more than 100 pages of docs.

## Timeline Overview

```yaml
Week 1 (Current): Core Implementation
  - Basic intent recognition
  - Voice input prototype
  - 10-20 working commands
  - Error recovery basics

Week 2: Polish & Testing
  - Demo video creation
  - Private beta testing
  - Security review
  - Launch materials prep

Week 3: Coordinated Launch
  - GitHub repository update
  - Multi-channel announcement
  - Live demo session
  - Community engagement
```

## Pre-Launch Strategy

### 1. GitHub Repository Decision

**Decision: Keep "nixos-gui" name** ‚úÖ

Reasons:
- Maintains existing stars/watchers (social proof)
- SEO value from existing links
- Add "Luminous Nix" as tagline
- No broken links in community

### 2. Community Soft Launch (This Week)

```yaml
Actions:
  1. NixOS Discourse:
     - Create "Luminous Nix" discussion
     - Share vision without implementation details
     - Gather use case feedback
     
  2. Private Beta List:
     - Recruit 5-10 early testers
     - Focus on diverse personas
     - Build excitement quietly
     
  3. Teaser Website:
     - One-page vision statement
     - Email signup for launch
     - Link to philosophy docs
```

### 3. Implementation Priorities

```yaml
Week 1 Must-Haves:
  - "Install [package]" command
  - "My internet isn't working" diagnostic
  - "What is [thing]?" explanations
  - "Show me installed programs"
  - "Update my system"
  - "Make text bigger" accessibility
  - Voice input (basic)
  - Error recovery (basic)
  
Week 1 Nice-to-Haves:
  - "Setup development environment"
  - "Configure [service]"
  - "Check system health"
  - Multi-language intent recognition
```
