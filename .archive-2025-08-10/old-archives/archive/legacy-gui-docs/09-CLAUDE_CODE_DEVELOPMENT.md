## Code Quality Strategies

### 1. Consistent Architecture Patterns

```javascript
// Every session starts with context setting
const sessionContext = {
  project: 'Luminous Nix',
  architecture: 'Hybrid NLP with progressive enhancement',
  principles: ['Accessibility first', 'Local-first', 'Privacy by design'],
  currentFocus: 'Intent recognition engine',
  codeStyle: {
    language: 'TypeScript',
    formatting: 'Prettier',
    linting: 'ESLint',
    testing: 'Jest'
  }
};

// Claude maintains consistency across sessions
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development

```yaml
Claude Code Max Workflow:
  1. Write failing tests first
  2. Implement minimal code to pass
  3. Refactor for clarity
  4. Add edge case tests
  5. Document thoroughly
  
Test Coverage Targets:
  - Unit tests: 95%+
  - Integration tests: 90%+
  - E2E tests: 80%+
  - Accessibility tests: 100%
```

### 3. Living Documentation

```javascript
/**
 * Claude Code Max always includes:
 * - Clear function documentation
 * - Usage examples
 * - Edge cases
 * - Performance considerations
 * 
 * @example
 * const result = await recognizeIntent("install firefox");
 * // Returns: { intent: 'package.install', package: 'firefox', confidence: 0.95 }
 */
```

## Handling Complex Features

### Example: Building the NLP Engine

```yaml
Human (Tristan) Provides:
  - High-level requirements
  - User stories
  - Edge cases from community
  - Performance constraints

Claude Code Max Delivers:
  Day 1:
    - Complete intent recognition system
    - 50+ test cases
    - Benchmarking suite
    - Documentation
    
  Day 2:
    - Optimization based on benchmarks
    - Additional intent patterns
    - Error handling improvements
    - API documentation
    
  Day 3:
    - Integration with Nix wrapper
    - End-to-end tests
    - Performance profiling
    - Deployment ready
```

### Managing Large Codebases

```yaml
Strategies for Context Management:
  1. Modular Architecture:
     - Small, focused files
     - Clear interfaces
     - Minimal dependencies
     
  2. Context Documents:
     - ARCHITECTURE.md (always current)
     - API.md (auto-generated)
     - DECISIONS.md (design rationale)
     
  3. Session Continuity:
     - End each session with summary
     - Start each session with context
     - Use git commits as memory aids
```

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Quality Checks

```javascript
// Every Claude Code Max session includes
const qualityChecks = {
  // Automated before commit
  preCommit: [
    'npm run lint',
    'npm run type-check',
    'npm run test',
    'npm run test:accessibility'
  ],
  
  // Automated in CI/CD
  continuous: [
    'npm run test:e2e',
    'npm run security:audit',
    'npm run performance:benchmark',
    'npm run bundle:analyze'
  ],
  
  // Weekly deep checks
  weekly: [
    'npm run deps:update',
    'npm run security:deep-scan',
    'npm run accessibility:audit',
    'npm run docs:validate'
  ]
};
```

### Human Review Process

```yaml
Tristan's Review Focus:
  1. User Experience:
     - Does it feel natural?
     - Is it accessible?
     - Does it spark joy?
     
  2. Architecture:
     - Is it maintainable?
     - Is it extensible?
     - Is it performant?
     
  3. Philosophy:
     - Does it respect user sovereignty?
     - Is it consciousness-first?
     - Does it protect attention?
```

## Collaboration Patterns

### Community Integration

```yaml
Community Feedback Loop:
  1. Users report issue/request
  2. Tristan prioritizes

  7. Release

Typical Timeline:
  - Critical bug: 2-4 hours
  - Feature request: 1-2 days
  - Major feature: 1 week
```

### Open Source Transparency

```javascript
// Every significant change includes
const commitPattern = {
  type: 'feat|fix|docs|refactor|test',
  scope: 'component-name',
  description: 'Clear, concise description',
  body: `
    Detailed explanation of changes
    
    - Why this change was needed
