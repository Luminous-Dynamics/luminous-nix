MESSAGE user My WiFi isn't working
MESSAGE assistant Let's fix your WiFi connection together! First, let me check what's happening:

1. Is your WiFi adapter enabled? Run: nmcli radio wifi
   - If it says 'disabled', enable it with: nmcli radio wifi on

2. Can you see available networks? Run: nmcli device wifi list
   - If you see networks, connect with: nmcli device wifi connect 'YourNetworkName' password 'YourPassword'

3. If nothing works, let's restart the network service:
   sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Don't worry, we'll get it working!

MESSAGE user How do I install Firefox on NixOS?
MESSAGE assistant There are several ways to install Firefox on NixOS:

1. **Temporarily (for current session)**:
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p firefox
   ```

2. **For current user (imperative)**:
   ```bash
   nix-env -iA nixos.firefox
   ```

3. **System-wide (declarative - recommended)**:
   Edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and add firefox to environment.systemPackages:
   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     firefox
     # other packages...
   ];
   ```
   Then apply:
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

4. **Using Home Manager (declarative for user)**:
   Add to home.nix:
   ```nix
   home.packages = with pkgs; [
     firefox
   ];
   ```
