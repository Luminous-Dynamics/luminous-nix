# Week 1 Pragmatic Decisions - Nix for Humanity

## Focus: Ship Working Code

### Development Decisions

1. **Environment**: Use existing Tauri setup ✅
   - Already working in `src-tauri/`
   - Add TypeScript configs as needed
   - Don't over-engineer

2. **Git Strategy**: Stay on main branch ✅
   - Solo developer = no PR overhead
   - Faster iteration
   - Can always revert

3. **Communication**: Delay until Week 2 ⏳
   - 100% focus on building
   - GitHub issues for self-tracking
   - Community can wait for working demo

4. **Testing**: Local only for Week 1 🎯
   - Simple `npm test`
   - No CI/CD setup yet
   - Bash script sufficient

5. **Accessibility**: Simple checklist 📝
   - Orca screen reader
   - Keyboard navigation
   - High contrast
   - 200% zoom test

6. **Voice**: Web Speech API first 🎤
   - Free, no API keys
   - Good enough for demo
   - Enhance later

## The Mindset

```yaml
Say YES to:
  - Writing code that works
  - Simple solutions
  - Local testing
  - Quick iterations
  - Good enough

Say NO to:
  - Perfect architecture
  - Complex tooling
  - Premature optimization
  - Community building
  - Bike-shedding
```

## Remember

Every hour on setup is an hour not making Grandma Rose's life easier.

**Start coding. Build momentum. Ship it.**
