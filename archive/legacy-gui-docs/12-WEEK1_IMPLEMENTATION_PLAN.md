## Core Commands to Implement

### Priority 1 (Must Have)
```yaml
1. Package Installation:
   - "Install firefox"
   - "I need a web browser"
   - "Install that coding program"
   
2. System Updates:
   - "Update my system"
   - "Check for updates"
   - "Is my system up to date?"
   
3. Basic Troubleshooting:
   - "My internet isn't working"
   - "The screen is too small"
   - "I can't hear any sound"
   
4. Information Queries:
   - "What is installed?"
   - "Show me my programs"
   - "What is Firefox?"
   
5. Accessibility:
   - "Make the text bigger"
   - "I can't see well"
   - "Use high contrast"
```

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
```yaml
6. Development Setup:
   - "Set up Python"
   - "I want to code"
   - "Install development tools"
   
7. Service Management:
   - "Start the web server"
   - "Stop MySQL"
   - "What's running?"
   
8. Configuration:
   - "Change my wallpaper"
   - "Set up automatic updates"
   - "Configure backups"
```

### Key Implementation Details

#### Intent Recognition
```typescript
interface Intent {
  type: 'install' | 'update' | 'query' | 'config' | 'troubleshoot';
  confidence: number;
  entities: Entity[];
  alternatives: Intent[];
}

class IntentEngine {
  recognize(input: string): Intent {
    // 1. Clean and normalize
    // 2. Pattern matching (fast path)
    // 3. Statistical model (flexibility)
    // 4. Ensemble decision
  }
}
```

#### Safety Wrapper
```typescript
class NixSafeWrapper {
  async execute(command: NixCommand): Promise<Result> {
    // 1. Validate command
    // 2. Create rollback point
    // 3. Execute with timeout
    // 4. Verify success
    // 5. Return natural language result
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] 10+ working commands
- [ ] Voice input functional
- [ ] Error recovery working
- [ ] Accessibility compliant
- [ ] Sub-2 second response

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Lighthouse score >90
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Demo Requirements
- [ ] Grandma Rose can install Firefox
- [ ] Maya can set up dev environment
- [ ] David can check system status
- [ ] Dr. Sarah can query packages
- [ ] Alex can use voice-only

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Voice recognition accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Fallback to text, confirmation prompts

2. **Nix command complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with safe subset, extensive testing

3. **Performance on old hardware**
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, lazy loading

### Time Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict priority system, say no

2. **Perfectionism**
   - Mitigation: "Good enough" for demo, iterate later

3. **Unknown unknowns**
   - Mitigation: 20% buffer time, quick pivots

## The North Star

**Remember**: We're not building a command-line wrapper. We're creating a conversation between human and computer. Every interaction should feel natural, helpful, and empowering.

**Grandma Rose Test**: If Rose can't use it, it's not ready.

Let's build something beautiful! ðŸš€
