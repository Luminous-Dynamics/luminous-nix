## What is Nix for Humanity?

**Nix for Humanity transforms NixOS from command-line only to natural conversation.**

Instead of typing:
```bash
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.firefox
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

Users simply say:
```
"I need a web browser"
"My internet isn't working"
"Install that coding program"
```

## üöÄ Revolutionary Development Model

Built by **one developer + Claude Code Max** for **$200/month**:

| Metric | Traditional Team | Solo + Claude Max |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2-Year Cost | $4,200,000 | $24,440 |
| Time to MVP | 6 months | 2 weeks |
| Team Size | 10-12 people | 1 person |
| Success Chance | 30% | 85% |

## üé≠ The Five Personas

### 1. Grandma Rose (75)
*"I just want to write letters to my grandchildren"*
- Never sees a terminal
- Voice commands only
- Everything just works

### 2. Maya (16)
*"I want to code and game"*
- Rapid-fire commands
- Discovers power features
- Becomes contributor

### 3. David (42)
*"I need reliable computers for my restaurant"*
- Business-focused
- Stability first
- ROI driven

### 4. Dr. Sarah (35)
*"I need reproducible research environments"*
- Technical depth
- Appreciates NixOS power
- Shares configurations

### 5. Alex (28, Blind)
*"I need a system I can manage independently"*
- Voice-first interaction
- Perfect accessibility
- True independence
