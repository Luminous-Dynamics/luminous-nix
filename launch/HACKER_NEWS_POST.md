# Hacker News Launch Post

## Title Options (pick the best performer):

1. **Show HN: I built a natural language interface for NixOS in 2 weeks with AI ($200/mo)**
2. **Show HN: Making NixOS accessible through natural conversation (95% test coverage)**  
3. **Show HN: Solo dev + AI = NixOS for humans (0.63ms response time)**

## Post Body:

Hi HN! I built Luminous Nix because NixOS is incredibly powerful but painfully difficult to learn. Instead of memorizing commands like `nix-env -iA nixos.firefox`, you can now just type `ask-nix "install firefox"`.

**Key achievements:**
- 0.63ms average response time (158x faster than target)
- 95% test coverage with 58 comprehensive tests
- Built in 2 weeks by one developer + AI collaboration
- Total cost: $200/month in AI tools

**The Sacred Trinity development model:**
1. Human (me): Vision, architecture, testing
2. Claude AI: Rapid code generation and problem solving
3. Local LLMs: NixOS domain expertise

This isn't a wrapper around nix commands - it's a complete rethinking of how humans interact with NixOS. Natural language processing understands intent ("find me something to edit photos" â†’ GIMP, Krita, Darktable), educational error messages teach instead of frustrate, and generation management makes experimentation safe.

**Technical highlights:**
- Pure Python with Poetry for dependency management
- Service layer architecture (no code duplication between CLI/TUI/Voice)
- Two-tier caching (memory + disk) with TTL expiration
- Comprehensive test suite including integration tests

**Try it:**
```
curl -sSL https://luminous-nix.dev/install.sh | bash
ask-nix "help me set up Python development"
```

I'm especially interested in feedback on:
1. The natural language patterns - what feels intuitive?
2. The development model - could this work for other projects?
3. Feature requests - what would make NixOS easier for you?

Happy to answer questions about the AI collaboration process, the technical implementation, or NixOS in general!

## Comments to Have Ready:

**If asked about AI replacing developers:**
"AI didn't replace me - it amplified me. I still made all the architectural decisions, tested everything, and provided the vision. AI just helped me code at 10x speed. It's like having a brilliant junior developer who never sleeps but needs constant direction."

**If asked about the $200/month:**
"Claude API costs about $150/month at my usage level, and I run Mistral-7B locally for NixOS-specific knowledge (electricity ~$50/month). Compared to hiring even one developer, it's incredibly cost-effective."

**If asked about test coverage:**
"The 95% is real, verified coverage - not phantom tests. We actually had to remove 955 broken tests for non-existent features. Every test actually runs against real functionality."

**If asked why NixOS needs this:**
"NixOS is genuinely revolutionary - reproducible, unbreakable systems. But the learning curve keeps it niche. If we can make it as easy as Ubuntu while keeping all the power, it could transform how we think about operating systems."
