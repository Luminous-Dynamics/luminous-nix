## Key Messages

### Core Value Proposition
"Natural language for NixOS - just say what you want"

### Unique Differentiators
1. **0.63ms response time** - Impossibly fast
2. **Built in 2 weeks** - Incredible velocity
3. **$200/month** - Radical economics
4. **95% test coverage** - Production ready
5. **Sacred Trinity model** - Revolutionary development

### Audience-Specific Angles

#### For NixOS Users
"Finally, NixOS for humans"

#### For Developers
"AI-augmented development actually works"

#### For Beginners
"Learn NixOS in 15 minutes"

#### For Enterprises
"Production-ready from day one"

## Common Questions & Answers

### "Is this just a wrapper?"
No, it's a complete service layer with natural language understanding, intelligent caching, and deep NixOS integration.

### "Does it require internet?"
No, works completely offline. The AI for natural language runs locally.

### "What about security?"
All processing is local. We passed comprehensive security audits (Bandit, Safety, pip-audit).

### "Will it break my system?"
No, safe by default. Dry-run mode, generation management, and automatic rollback points.

### "How does the AI development model work?"
Human provides vision and testing, Claude generates code rapidly, local LLMs provide domain expertise. Total cost: $200/month.

## Response Templates

### For Skeptics
"I understand the skepticism! Here's a demo: [link]. The code is 100% open source, so you can verify everything yourself. Performance benchmarks are in `/tests/performance/`."

### For Enthusiasts
"Thank you! üôè Would love your feedback on what features would help most. The roadmap is open for discussion at [link]."

### For Technical Questions
"Great question! The technical details are in this article: [link]. TL;DR: Service layer architecture + aggressive caching + direct Python-Nix bindings = 0.63ms response."

### For Contributors
"Contributions welcome! Check out the good-first-issue tags. The development guide is here: [link]. We use Poetry for dependencies and have comprehensive tests."

## Emergency Responses

### If Site Goes Down
"High traffic! üöÄ Mirror at: [backup-link]. Installation also works directly from GitHub."

### If Critical Bug Found
"Thanks for finding this! Tracking in issue #X. Workaround: [solution]. Fix coming in hot patch."

### If Accused of Hype
"Fair concern! Here's the actual performance data: [link]. Every claim is backed by tests you can run yourself."

We're not just launching software. We're launching a movement.

**Let's make NixOS accessible to everyone. Let's democratize software development. Let's show the world what Human + AI can achieve.**
