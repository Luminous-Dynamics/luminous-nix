## Version History Notes

### Why 0.3.0?
Despite various tools claiming to be v2, v3, v6, etc., the actual project progression:
- 0.1.0: Initial conception and planning (extensive docs, no code)
- 0.2.0: First working prototype (ask-nix-hybrid)  
- 0.3.0: Enhanced versions with execution capability

### Previous Version Confusion
- Files referenced non-existent v6
- Tools numbered arbitrarily (v2, v3)
- No consistent versioning strategy
- This changelog establishes clean versioning going forward

### Archived GUI History
Early project exploration included GUI concepts before pivoting to natural language. This helped inform the current design where visual elements support rather than lead interaction.
