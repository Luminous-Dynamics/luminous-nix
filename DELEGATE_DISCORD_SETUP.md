```
Hey! I'm launching Luminous Nix on Hacker News Tuesday and need help setting up Discord. 

It's a natural language interface for NixOS that I built in 2 weeks for $200 (beating a $4.2M enterprise quote!).

Could you help me set up a basic Discord server? I'll make you a moderator!

Here's what I need:
- Server name: "Luminous Nix | Natural Language NixOS"
- Basic channels (welcome, general, help, bugs, showcase)
- Simple welcome message
- Invite link I can share

The setup guide is here: [link to DISCORD_QUICK_SETUP.md]

I'll give you admin/mod permissions. This would really help me focus on the launch!

Thanks!
```

## People Who Might Help

### 1. Ask in Existing Communities
Post in developer Discords/Slacks you're already in:
```
"Launching my open source project on HN Tuesday. 
Anyone willing to help set up a Discord server? 
Takes 15 mins, you'll be a founding moderator!"
```

### 2. Twitter/X Request
```

## Alternative: Discord Setup Services

### Fiverr (Fast)
- Search "Discord server setup"
- $5-25 for basic setup
- 1-2 hour delivery

### Discord Partners

  - Moderator role
  - Credit/recognition
  - Small payment ($20-50)

### Local Tech Communities

## The "Community First" Approach

**Post this in your HN launch:**

```
"I'm focused on answering your questions here, but we need a Discord!

If someone wants to help set up our community server, 
DM me - you'll be a founding moderator!"
```

**You'll get volunteers immediately!** People love being part of launch stories.

## Why This Works

1. **People love helping launches** - They want to be part of the story
2. **Discord pros enjoy it** - Server setup is fun for them
3. **Instant moderators** - Helpers become invested community members
4. **You focus on launch** - Handle the critical HN discussion
5. **Community building** - Delegation itself builds community

## Emergency Backup

If no Discord by launch, just share:
- GitHub Discussions
- Email list (Google Form)
- Twitter for updates
- "Discord coming soon - volunteer to help!"

**Remember**: Discord is nice but not critical for launch success. HN discussion + GitHub is enough!
