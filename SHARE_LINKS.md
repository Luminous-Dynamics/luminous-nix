Title: Natural language interface for NixOS - looking for beta testers!

Hey r/NixOS!

I built Luminous Nix to make NixOS accessible through natural language. Instead of memorizing commands, you just say what you want:

- "install firefox"
- "create python dev environment"  
- "why is my wifi not working?"

Built using Sacred Trinity Development (Human + Claude + Local LLM) in 2 weeks for $200.

Would love your feedback and beta testers!

Excited to launch Luminous Nix - making NixOS accessible to everyone through natural language!

After receiving a $4.2M enterprise quote, I built this in 2 weeks for $200 using AI collaboration.

This proves what's possible when we rethink development with Human-AI partnership.

Subject: Launching: Natural Language NixOS - Built for $200, Not $4.2M

Hi [Name],

Today we're launching Luminous Nix on Hacker News - a natural language interface that makes NixOS accessible to everyone.

The interesting part: After enterprise consultants quoted $4.2M and 18 months, I built this in 2 weeks for $200 using Sacred Trinity Development (Human + Claude + Local LLM collaboration).

Key achievements:
â€¢ 10x-1500x performance improvement with Python-Nix API
â€¢ Works for everyone from grandmothers to developers
â€¢ 100% local and private
â€¢ Already functional with voice interface coming

This proves a new development model is possible - and profitable.

Would love your thoughts.

Best,
Tristan
