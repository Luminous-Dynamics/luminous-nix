# üöÄ Future Testing Roadmap & Research Plan

## üìä Current State (Reality Check)
- **11 passing tests** for actual features
- **8% real coverage** (not 95% as claimed)
- **955 broken tests** for non-existent features

## üî¨ Research Areas

### 1. VM Testing Infrastructure
**Goal**: Test real NixOS operations without affecting host

**Research Questions**:
- Lightweight VM options (microVM, Firecracker, QEMU)
- NixOS test framework integration
- CI/CD pipeline with VM tests
- Snapshot and rollback strategies

**Proof of Concept**:
```nix
# tests/vm/basic-nixos-test.nix
import <nixpkgs/nixos/tests/make-test-python.nix> ({ pkgs, ... }: {
  name = "luminous-nix-basic";
  
  machine = { ... }: {
    imports = [ ./test-configuration.nix ];
    services.luminous-nix.enable = true;
  };
  
  testScript = ''
    machine.wait_for_unit("luminous-nix.service")
    machine.succeed("ask-nix 'install firefox'")
    machine.wait_until_succeeds("firefox --version")
  '';
})
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing
**Goal**: Generate test cases automatically to find edge cases

**Tools to Evaluate**:
- Hypothesis for Python
- QuickCheck patterns
- Fuzzing for CLI inputs

**Example Research**:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.text())
def test_cli_handles_any_input(user_input):
    """CLI should never crash, regardless of input."""
    result = cli.process(user_input)
    assert result.status in ['success', 'error', 'help']
    assert not result.crashed
```

### 3. Mutation Testing
**Goal**: Verify test quality by mutating code

**Research Areas**:
- mutmut for Python
- Infection for coverage quality
- Automated test improvement

### 4. Contract Testing
**Goal**: Ensure API compatibility between components

**Focus Areas**:
- Backend <-> CLI contract
- Backend <-> TUI contract
- REST API versioning

### 5. Performance Testing
**Goal**: Ensure sub-second response times

**Metrics to Track**:
- CLI command latency
- Memory usage over time
- Concurrent user handling
- Cache effectiveness

## üí° Key Principles Going Forward

1. **Reality First**: Test what exists, not what we wish existed
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build testing capabilities incrementally
3. **User-Centric**: Test user journeys, not just code units
4. **Automation**: Automate repetitive testing tasks
5. **Learning**: Each test failure teaches us something

## üåä Sacred Testing Wisdom

> "A test that never runs is a lie.  
> A test that always passes teaches nothing.  
> A test that sometimes fails is a teacher.  
> A test suite that grows with the code is alive."
