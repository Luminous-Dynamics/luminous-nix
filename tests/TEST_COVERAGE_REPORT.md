## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Basic unit tests
python tests/run_unit_tests.py

# With coverage (in Nix environment)
nix-shell -p python3Packages.coverage --run "python tests/run_all_tests.py --coverage"

# Generate HTML coverage report
nix-shell -p python3Packages.coverage --run "python tests/run_all_tests.py --coverage --html"

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest tests.unit.test_intent_engine -v

# Run with failfast
python tests/run_all_tests.py --failfast
```

## Security Fixes Implemented

1. **Command Injection Prevention** - Added pipe character detection in validate_command
2. **EXPLAIN Mode Security** - Ensures explain mode never executes commands
3. **Pattern Matching** - Fixed dangerous pattern detection for curl|sh attacks
4. **Input Validation** - All user inputs are now properly validated
