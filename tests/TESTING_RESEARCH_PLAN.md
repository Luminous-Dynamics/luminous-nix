# üî¨ Testing Research Plan

## Executive Summary

We discovered 955 broken tests for non-existent features. This research plan ensures we build a real, valuable test suite grounded in actual implementation while preparing for future growth.

## üéØ Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Establish Real Baseline**: Document what actually exists vs what's aspirational
2. **Define Testing Strategy**: Create pragmatic approach for our resources
3. **Plan Growth Path**: Map how testing evolves with features
4. **Prevent Regression**: Never again test phantom features

### Success Criteria
- 30% real coverage in 3 months
- 0 tests for non-existent features
- All new features have tests
- Clear testing guidelines established

## üîç Research Areas

### 1. Architecture Reality Mapping
**Objective**: Document actual vs claimed architecture

**Research Tasks**:
- [ ] Audit all imports in existing tests
- [ ] Map which classes/functions actually exist
- [ ] Identify aspirational vs real features
- [ ] Create definitive feature inventory

**Deliverable**: `ACTUAL_FEATURES.md` listing what really exists

### 2. Optimal Testing Stack
**Objective**: Choose right tools for our needs

**Evaluate**:
| Tool | Purpose | Priority | Decision |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| pytest | Test runner | High | ‚úÖ Already using |
| pytest-cov | Coverage | High | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| pytest-mock | Mocking | High | Research needed |
| hypothesis | Property testing | Medium | Future |
| pytest-bdd | Behavior tests | Low | Future |
| tox | Multi-env testing | Medium | Research needed |

### 3. Mock Strategy Research
**Objective**: Define when/how to mock

**Questions to Answer**:
- When should we mock NixOS operations?
- How to mock without hiding real issues?
- What should NEVER be mocked?

**Experiment**: Create three versions of a test:
1. Full mock (fastest, least real)
2. Partial mock (balanced)
3. No mock (slowest, most real)

Compare speed, reliability, and value.

### 4. VM Testing Feasibility
**Objective**: Determine if/when VM testing makes sense

**Research Tasks**:
- [ ] Evaluate NixOS test framework
- [ ] Prototype basic VM test
- [ ] Measure resource requirements
- [ ] Cost/benefit analysis

**Key Questions**:
- Can GitHub Actions handle VM tests?
- What's minimum viable VM testing?
- When do benefits outweigh costs?

### 5. Coverage Strategy
**Objective**: Define meaningful coverage goals

**Research Focus**:
- What coverage % is realistic?
- Which code needs 100% coverage?
- What can have lower coverage?
- How to measure feature coverage?

**Proposed Tiers**:
```yaml
Critical (90%+ coverage):
  - Error handling
  - Security validators
  - Core backend engine

Important (70%+ coverage):
  - CLI commands
  - Configuration management
  - Intent recognition

Standard (50%+ coverage):
  - UI components
  - Logging
  - Utilities

Optional (30%+ coverage):
  - Demo features
  - Experimental code
  - Development tools
```

## üìä Testing Metrics Research

### What to Measure
1. **Coverage Metrics**
   - Line coverage
   - Branch coverage
   - Feature coverage (custom metric)

2. **Quality Metrics**

### How to Track
```python
# tests/metrics/tracker.py
class TestMetrics:
    def track_test_run(self):
        return {
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'coverage': self.get_coverage(),
            'runtime': self.get_runtime(),
            'failures': self.get_failures(),
            'skipped': self.get_skipped(),
            'features_tested': self.get_feature_coverage()
        }
```

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### From Our Experience
1. **Aspirational Testing**: Never test features that don't exist
2. **Coverage Theater**: Don't chase numbers over value
3. **Mock Everything**: Some things need real testing
4. **Test Later**: Tests should come WITH features

### Industry Anti-Patterns
1. **Ice Cream Cone**: Too many manual/E2E tests
2. **Hourglass**: Missing middle layer (integration)
3. **Testing Trophy**: Unbalanced test distribution
4. **Fragile Tests**: Break with any change

## üéØ Key Research Questions

### Strategic Questions
1. What's our actual vs aspirational feature set?
2. What testing provides most value for effort?
3. How much testing is "enough"?
4. When should we add VM testing?

### Technical Questions
1. How to test NixOS operations safely?
2. What's the right mock/real balance?
3. How to test all 10 personas efficiently?

## üåä Wisdom Gained

> "We learned that testing the dream instead of the reality creates a nightmare of maintenance. Now we test what is, plan what will be, and document what was."

### Key Lessons
1. **Honesty > Ambition**: Real 8% coverage beats fake 95%
2. **Reality > Vision**: Test code, not documentation
3. **Pragmatism > Perfection**: Some tests better than perfect tests later
4. **Growth > Stagnation**: Evolve tests with code
