## Reason for Archive: The 955 Broken Tests Disaster

### What Happened
- We discovered 955 tests for features that don't exist
- Tests were written for aspirational features in documentation
- Created false "95% coverage" when reality was 8%
- Tests assumed 5 backends when only 1 exists (NixForHumanityBackend)

### What We're Archiving
- All tests that import non-existent modules
- Tests for advanced learning system (doesn't exist)
- Tests for multiple backends (only 1 exists)
- Tests for symbiotic intelligence features (not implemented)
- Tests for causal XAI engine (not built)

### Lessons Learned
1. **Test what IS, not what MIGHT BE**
2. **Build features WITH tests, not tests WITHOUT features**
3. **Documentation â‰  Implementation**
4. **Be honest about coverage**

### Files Archived
See list below - these are tests for phantom features.

### Root Tests (Broken) - 11 files archived
- test_unified_backend_features.py - Imports from non-existent scripts/backend
- test_component_integration.py - Tests non-existent research components (SKG, trust_engine)
- test_tui_structure.py - Checks wrong directory structure (src/tui instead of src/nix_for_humanity/tui)

### The Reality
- Only 11 tests actually work
- These test real, implemented features
- Real coverage is about 8%, not 95%
- **61 tests archived so far** (36 unit + 5 CLI + 9 integration + 11 root tests)
