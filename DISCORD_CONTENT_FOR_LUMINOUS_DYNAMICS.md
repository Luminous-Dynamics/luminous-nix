**🚀 Luminous Nix - Launching Tuesday on Hacker News!**

We're revolutionizing NixOS with natural language interaction!

**What is Luminous Nix?**
Instead of memorizing commands like `nix-env -iA nixos.firefox`, just say:
```
ask-nix "install firefox"
```
And it works! 

**The Story**
• Built in 2 weeks by 1 developer + AI collaboration
• Total cost: $200 (vs $4.2M enterprise quote!)
• 10x-1500x performance with Python-Nix API
• 100% local and private

**Launch Tuesday 9 AM EST**
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix
⭐ Please star the repo!
🔼 Watch for us on Hacker News

**Sacred Trinity Development**
This project proves what's possible with Human + Claude + Local LLM collaboration.

Join us in making Linux accessible to everyone - from developers to grandmothers!
