⚡ How we achieved 10x-1500x performance:

Skip subprocess → Use Python-Nix API directly

Before: 45s timeout on complex operations
After: 30ms response time

The secret? Native integration.

👵 Meet Grandma Rose, one of our 10 personas:

"Dear, to see your photos, just say 'install photo viewer'"

No terminal. No commands. Just natural language.

Tech should adapt to humans, not the other way around.

🎯 Error messages that actually help:

Traditional NixOS:
"error: attribute 'fierfox' missing"

Luminous Nix:
"Did you mean 'firefox'? To install:
ask-nix 'install firefox'"

We teach, not just report.

2/ Create dev environment:
ask-nix "create python development setup"

3/ Debug issues:
ask-nix "why is my wifi not working?"

4/ Time travel:

No memorization needed!
