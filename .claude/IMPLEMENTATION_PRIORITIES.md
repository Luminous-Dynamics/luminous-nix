# Implementation Priorities - Nix for Humanity

## Core Principle: Natural Language Understanding First

### Phase 1: Natural Language Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Understand what users mean, regardless of how they express it

#### Week 1-2 Priorities
1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Intent recognition (what do they want?)
   - Entity extraction (what are they talking about?)
   - Variation handling ("install"/"get"/"i need")
   - Context awareness

2. **Input Methods (Both Equal)**
   ```
   Text Input:
   - Keyboard entry
   - Typo tolerance
   - Natural phrasing

   Voice Input:
   - Whisper.cpp integration
   - Microphone handling
   - Speech-to-text
   ```

3. **Core Intents to Recognize**
   ```
   Priority 1 (Day 1-3):
   - Install something
   - Remove something
   - Search for something

   Priority 2 (Day 4-7):
   - Update system
   - Show information
   - Get help

   Priority 3 (Week 2):
   - Fix problems
   - Configure settings
   - Undo actions
   ```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Understanding (Weeks 3-4)
- Understand variations ("browser" = firefox/chrome/etc)
- Handle ambiguity ("something for internet")
- Multi-turn conversations
- Learn from usage

### Phase 3: Optional Outputs (Weeks 5-6)
**After Natural Language Works**
- Visual feedback (GUI)
- Audio responses (TTS)
- Progress indicators
- Confirmation dialogs

## Testing Priorities

### Must Test With Every Feature
1. **Text Input** - Natural language typing
2. **Voice Input** - Natural language speaking
3. **Screen Reader** - Full accessibility
4. **Mixed Input** - Type some, speak some
5. **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling

### Persona Testing Priority
1. **Alex (Blind)** - Both text and voice with screen reader
2. **Grandma Rose** - Natural, non-technical phrases
3. **Maya (ADHD)** - Quick, efficient interaction
4. **David (Tired)** - Simple, stress-free
5. **Dr. Sarah** - Power user efficiency

## Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack (Best We Can Design)
```yaml
Core:
  - Language: Rust (performance-critical) + TypeScript (NLP flexibility)
  - Desktop: Tauri (lightweight, secure, native)
  - Mobile: Progressive Web App
  - NLP: Three-layer hybrid (rules + statistical + neural)
  - Voice: Whisper.cpp (best local STT)
  - Database: SQLite (embedded, reliable)

Frontend:
  - Framework: Vanilla JS + Web Components (no bloat)
  - Build: Vite (fastest, modern)
  - Style: CSS with custom properties
  - Accessibility: ARIA-first, WCAG AAA target

Infrastructure:
  - Testing: Jest + Playwright + Rust tests
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Security: Sandboxed execution, capability-based
  - Distribution: Nix flakes + native packages
```

### Natural Language Pipeline
```
User Input (text or voice)
    ↓
Natural Language Understanding
    ↓
Intent Recognition
    ↓
Entity Extraction
    ↓
Context Resolution
    ↓
Safety Validation
    ↓
Command Generation
    ↓
Execution
```

### Input/Output Architecture
```
Input Layer:
  Text → NLP Pipeline
  Voice → Speech-to-Text → NLP Pipeline

Output Layer:
  Text Response (always)
  + Visual GUI (optional)
  + Audio TTS (optional)
```

## Remember Always

1. **Natural language is the interface**
2. **Text and voice are equal inputs**
3. **GUI and audio are optional outputs**
4. **Test with real phrases people use**
5. **No commands to memorize**
