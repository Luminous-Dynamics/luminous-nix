# 🌟 Nix for Humanity - Complete Project Context

## Core Identity

**Project Name**: Nix for Humanity
**Organization**: Luminous-Dynamics (Founded by Tristan Stoltz)
**Tagline**: "Natural language interface for NixOS - Making Linux accessible to everyone"
**Philosophy**: Consciousness-First Computing without the philosophy talk
**License**: MIT License (for maximum adoption)
**Development Model**: Solo Developer + Claude Code Max ($200/month)

## 🎯 The Vision

Transform NixOS from command-line expert system to natural human conversation. NOT a GUI - users simply speak or type what they want naturally.

### Example Interactions
```
User: "I need a web browser"
System: "I'll install Firefox for you. Installing now... Done! You can find it in your applications."

User: "My internet isn't working"
System: "I'll help diagnose that. Checking... Your WiFi signal is weak. Would you like to try moving closer to the router or switch to a less crowded channel?"

User: "Install that programming thing everyone uses"
System: "Do you mean VS Code for writing code? Or Git for sharing code?"

User: "Make the text bigger, I can't see"
System: "I'll increase the system font size for you. Is this better?"
```

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Hybrid NLP Architecture
```
User Input (Voice/Text)
    ↓
Input Processing
    ↓
Hybrid NLP Engine:
  - Rule-based (fast path for common commands)
  - Statistical models (flexibility)
  - Neural networks (deep understanding)
    ↓
Intent + Entities + Confidence
    ↓
Nix Command Generation
    ↓
Safe Execution with Rollback
    ↓
Natural Language Response
```

### Technology Stack
- **Core Engine**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **NLP**: Hybrid approach (rules + CRF + small transformers)
- **Voice**: Web Speech API with Whisper.cpp fallback
