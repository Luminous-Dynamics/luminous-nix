# ðŸ§  Operational Intelligence - Core System Design

## Overview

Nix for Humanity isn't just a command translator - it's an intelligent system that learns and adapts to each user's unique patterns, preferences, and workflows. This document defines the core intelligence features that make our system truly context-aware.

## The Four Dimensions of Intelligence

### 1. WHO - User Pattern Recognition
The system learns who you are through your interactions:

```yaml
Pattern Recognition:
  - Command frequency and timing
  - Vocabulary preferences  
  - Technical skill level
  - Error patterns
  - Success patterns

Adaptation Examples:
  Developer: Shows package options with dev dependencies
  Casual User: Suggests GUI applications first
  System Admin: Offers batch operations and automation
```

### 2. WHAT - Intent Understanding
Goes beyond literal commands to understand true intent:

```yaml
Intent Mapping:
  "make it faster" â†’
    - For developer: Enable ccache, optimize builds
    - For gamer: Install gamemode, optimize GPU
    - For general user: Clean cache, remove old generations

  "something broke" â†’
    - Check recent changes
    - Suggest rollback options
    - Offer diagnostic steps
```

### 3. HOW - Method Preference Learning
Tracks how users prefer to accomplish tasks:

```yaml
Installation Methods:
  Declarative User:
    - Prefers configuration.nix
    - Wants reproducibility
    - Values system-wide changes

  Imperative User:
    - Uses nix-env commands
    - Wants quick testing
    - Values user-scoped changes

  Flakes User:
    - Prefers flake.nix
    - Wants pinned versions
    - Values reproducibility
```

### 4. WHEN - Workflow Intelligence
Respects user's time and workflow patterns:

```yaml
Timing Patterns:
  Work Hours:
    - Defer large updates
    - Minimize disruption
    - Quick operations only

  Maintenance Windows:
    - Schedule system rebuilds
    - Perform cleanup
    - Update channels

  Context Awareness:
    - Friday afternoon â†’ defer to Monday
    - During video call â†’ postpone audio updates
    - Low battery â†’ avoid intensive operations
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

```rust
pub struct OperationalIntelligence {
    user_profile: UserProfileLearner,
    intent_engine: IntentInferenceEngine,
    method_tracker: MethodPreferenceTracker,
    workflow_intel: WorkflowIntelligence,
    relationship_graph: PackageRelationshipGraph,
    rollback_predictor: RollbackPredictor,
    privacy_guard: PrivacyProtector,
}
```

### Learning Pipeline

1. **Capture** - Record user interactions with context
2. **Analyze** - Extract patterns and preferences
3. **Model** - Build user-specific behavioral model
4. **Predict** - Anticipate needs and preferences
5. **Adapt** - Adjust responses and suggestions
6. **Verify** - Confirm predictions with user

### Privacy-First Design

All learning happens locally with strong privacy guarantees:

```yaml
Privacy Principles:
  - No data leaves the machine
  - User owns all learned patterns
  - Easy export of personal model
  - One-click reset available
  - Transparent reasoning
  - No behavioral fingerprinting
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Package Installation Intelligence
```bash
User: "install python"

# System checks user history and finds:
# - Previously installed jupyter, pandas, numpy
# - Always uses Python for data science
# - Prefers conda environments

System: "I'll set up Python with your usual data science stack (numpy, pandas, jupyter). 
        Should I create a conda environment like you usually do?"
```

### Example 2: Timing Intelligence
```bash
# Friday, 4:47 PM
User: "update everything"

# System knows:
# - User typically leaves at 5 PM
# - Updates take ~45 minutes
# - Monday mornings are free

System: "A full update will take about 45 minutes. Would you like me to:
        1. Schedule it for Monday morning (recommended)
        2. Start now (might run past 5 PM)
        3. Just update security patches (5 minutes)"
```

### Example 3: Failure Prevention
```bash
User: "install nvidia drivers"

# System recalls:
# - User tried this 2 weeks ago
# - It broke the display manager
# - Rolled back to nouveau

System: "Last time we tried this, it conflicted with your display setup. 
        This time, I can:
        1. Create a backup generation first
        2. Try the newer 545 drivers (more stable)
        3. Help you check compatibility first"
```

## Learning Strategies

### Progressive Learning
- **Week 1**: Basic command patterns
- **Week 2**: Timing preferences
- **Week 3**: Method preferences
- **Month 2**: Complex relationships
- **Month 3**: Predictive suggestions

### Confidence Levels
```yaml
High Confidence (>90%):
  - Suggest automatically
  - Apply learned preferences
  
Medium Confidence (60-90%):
  - Ask for confirmation
  - Offer alternatives

Low Confidence (<60%):
  - Present options
  - Learn from choice
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Intent recognition accuracy: >85%
- Preference prediction: >90% after 1 week
- Timing optimization: 80% of updates in idle time
- Rollback reduction: 75% fewer failed updates

### Qualitative Metrics
- User reports feeling "understood"
- Decreased command repetition
- Increased task completion rate
- Reduced time to accomplish goals

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Multi-user household learning** - Different patterns per user
2. **Seasonal patterns** - Adapt to changing needs
3. **Project-based contexts** - Switch between work/personal/hobby
4. **Collaborative filtering** - Learn from similar users (privacy-preserved)

### Research Areas
1. **Predictive maintenance** - Anticipate issues before they occur
2. **Workflow optimization** - Suggest better ways to accomplish goals
3. **Learning transfer** - Help users discover new NixOS features
4. **Adaptive documentation** - Personalized help based on skill level

## Integration with Core System

The Operational Intelligence integrates seamlessly with:
- Natural Language Processing layer
- Command execution engine
- Safety validation system
- UI adaptation layer

Every component benefits from and contributes to the learning model.

## Ethical Considerations

### User Autonomy
- Never force learned behaviors
- Always provide manual override
- Explain reasoning when asked
- Respect user's choice to disable

### Transparency
- Show what was learned
- Explain why suggestions are made
- Allow inspection of user model
- Provide learning statistics

### Fairness
- No discrimination based on patterns
- Equal functionality for all users
- Accessible learning features
- Clear documentation of capabilities
