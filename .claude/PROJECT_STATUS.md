# Project Status - Luminous Nix

## Current State: Alpha Development Phase

### What's ACTUALLY Complete ‚úÖ
1. **Vision & Philosophy** - Clear understanding of context-aware natural language interface
2. **Technical Architecture** - Hybrid NLP design, Tauri implementation
3. **Development Approach** - Layered Reality (pure functions + real execution)
4. **Documentation** - Core docs complete (but scattered and inconsistent)
5. **Basic Infrastructure** - Tauri setup, TypeScript NLP structure

### What's In Progress üöß
1. **NLP Implementation** - Intent recognition patterns defined, not fully implemented
2. **Tauri Integration** - IPC bridge created, needs connection to NLP
3. **Command Execution** - Safety framework designed, needs testing
4. **Documentation Cleanup** - Removing GUI references, consolidating vision

### What's NOT Started ‚ùå
1. **Voice Integration** - Whisper.cpp planned but not integrated
2. **Learning System** - Operational Intelligence designed but not built
3. **User Testing** - No real users yet
4. **Distribution** - Flake created but not tested

## The Truth About "Completion"

Despite various documents claiming 90-95% completion, the reality is:
- **Design**: 90% complete ‚úÖ
- **Documentation**: 70% complete (needs consistency)
- **Implementation**: 20% complete üöß
- **Testing**: 5% complete
- **Overall**: ~30% complete

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Clean up documentation** - Remove all GUI references
2. **Connect NLP to Tauri** - Make basic commands work
3. **Test with real NixOS** - Verify command execution
4. **Create demo video** - Show natural language in action

## Development Timeline (Realistic)

### Month 1 (Current)
- Documentation cleanup ‚úÖ
- Basic NLP implementation
- 10 working commands
- Alpha testing

### Month 2
- Expand to 50 commands
- Add learning basics
- Beta release
- Community feedback

### Month 3
- Voice integration
- Full learning system
- Production release
- Documentation complete

## Key Blockers

1. **Documentation Confusion** - Mixed messages about GUI vs Natural Language
2. **Implementation Gap** - Design complete, code not matching
3. **No User Testing** - Need real feedback ASAP

## Remember

We're building a **context-aware natural language interface**, NOT a GUI. Every decision should support natural language understanding and user learning.
