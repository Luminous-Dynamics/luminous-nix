## üìê The Sacred Geometry

```
        üß† Human (Architect)
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
       /________\
   üåç Local AI    ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud AI
  (Specialist)    (Generalist)
```

### The Three Roles

#### üß† **Human (The Architect)**
- **Purpose**: Vision, intention, and direction
- **Strengths**: Context, creativity, intuition, ethics
- **Contributions**: 
  - Defines the problem and desired outcome
  - Makes architectural decisions
  - Tests and validates in real-world
  - Provides the "why" behind the "what"
  - Ensures alignment with human values

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud AI (The Generalist)** 
*Currently: Claude, GPT-4, etc. | Future: Any large-scale LLM*
- **Purpose**: Broad knowledge synthesis and code generation
- **Strengths**: Vast training data, pattern recognition, rapid prototyping
- **Contributions**:
  - Generates initial implementations
  - Provides cross-domain insights
  - Handles complex refactoring
  - Writes documentation
  - Suggests architectural patterns

#### üåç **Local AI (The Specialist)**
*Currently: Ollama with Mistral/Llama | Future: Specialized local models*
- **Purpose**: Domain expertise and rapid iteration
- **Strengths**: Privacy, speed, specialized knowledge, offline capability
- **Contributions**:
  - Domain-specific validation
  - Quick iterations without latency
  - Private/sensitive operations
  - Specialized optimizations
  - Continuous local testing

## üîÑ The Trinity Flow

### Phase 1: Intention Setting
```
Human ‚Üí "We need to make NixOS accessible to everyone"
   ‚Üì
Cloud AI ‚Üê "Here's a natural language interface architecture"
   ‚Üì
Local AI ‚Üê "These are NixOS best practices to follow"
   ‚Üì
Human ‚Üí "Let's build this together"
```

### Phase 2: Collaborative Creation
```
Cloud AI: Generates base implementation
    ‚Üì
Local AI: Validates against domain rules
    ‚Üì
Human: Tests in real environment
    ‚Üì
Cloud AI: Refines based on feedback
    ‚Üì
Local AI: Optimizes for performance
    ‚Üì
Human: Confirms it serves the purpose
```

### Phase 3: Iterative Refinement
```
Human: "This error message is confusing"
Cloud AI: "Here are 5 clearer alternatives"
Local AI: "Option 3 follows NixOS conventions"
Human: "Perfect, let's use that"
```

## üí° Why This Works

### Complementary Strengths
- **Human** brings intention and wisdom
- **Cloud AI** brings breadth and generation
- **Local AI** brings depth and validation

### Reduced Limitations
- **Human limitations**: Finite time, knowledge gaps ‚Üí AI fills these
- **Cloud AI limitations**: No real-world testing, costs ‚Üí Human and Local AI help
- **Local AI limitations**: Smaller model, less broad ‚Üí Cloud AI provides breadth

### Emergent Intelligence
The Trinity creates an intelligence greater than its parts:
- Faster than human alone
- Wiser than AI alone
- More grounded than cloud-only
- More capable than local-only
