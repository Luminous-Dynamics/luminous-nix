# ü§ù Contributing to Nix for Humanity

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nix for Humanity! We're building technology that makes NixOS accessible to everyone through natural language, and we'd love your help.

## üåü Our Philosophy

We follow the **Sacred Trinity** development model:
- **Human** provides vision and testing
- **AI** assists with implementation  
- **Community** guides evolution

This project proves that $200/month in AI tools can achieve what traditionally requires millions in funding.

## How Can I Contribute?

### üó£Ô∏è Add Natural Language Patterns
The easiest way to contribute! Help us understand more ways people express NixOS commands:

```python
# In src/nix_for_humanity/knowledge/patterns.py
INSTALL_PATTERNS = [
    "install {package}",
    "add {package}",
    "get {package}",
    "i need {package}",  # Add your pattern here!
]
```

### üêõ Report Bugs
Found something that doesn't work? [Create an issue](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) with:
- The command you tried
- What you expected
- What actually happened
- Your NixOS version

### üí° Suggest Enhancements

### üìñ Improve Documentation
Documentation can always be better! Fix typos, clarify explanations, or add examples.

### üß™ Add Tests
Help us maintain quality by adding tests:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_your_feature.py
```

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity
cd nix-for-humanity
```

2. **Enter development environment**
```bash
nix develop  # Provides all dependencies
# OR
poetry install --all-extras  # If you have Poetry
```

3. **Make your changes**
```bash

## Code Style

We use automated formatting - just run before committing:
```bash
poetry run black .           # Format Python
poetry run ruff check --fix . # Fix linting issues
```

## Commit Messages

```
feat: add support for "please install X" pattern
fix: handle packages with hyphens correctly
docs: clarify natural language examples
test: add coverage for search command
```
