## 🚀 You Can Now Do Everything!

### Test Voice Interface
```bash
# Test Whisper
whisper --help
echo "Recording test" | whisper --model base

# Test Piper  
echo "Hello from Luminous Nix!" | piper --list-models

# Run full voice demo
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/luminous-nix
poetry run python demo_voice_with_nix.py
```

### Use Development Flow Helper
```bash
./dev-flow.sh         # Start development session
./dev-flow.sh voice   # Test voice setup
./dev-flow.sh format  # Format code
./dev-flow.sh test    # Run tests
```

### Beautiful Transparent Terminals
```bash
kt          # Transparent Kitty (0.85 opacity)
kt-clear    # Very transparent (0.5 opacity)
kt-blur     # More blur visible (0.75 opacity)
kt-float    # Floating appearance with padding
```
