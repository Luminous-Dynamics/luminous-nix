# Phase 3 Implementation Plan - The Humane Interface

## Current Reality (as of 2025-08-11)

### ✅ What's Actually Working:
1. **Basic Voice Module** - Structure exists but needs integration
2. **TUI Interface** - Beautiful and working
3. **CLI Interface** - Natural language working well
4. **Error Intelligence** - 40+ patterns implemented

### ❌ What's Missing/Broken:
1. **Whisper/Piper Integration** - Not actually connected
2. **Calculus of Interruption** - Module doesn't exist
3. **Causal XAI with DoWhy** - Not installed or integrated
4. **Conversational Repair** - Not implemented
5. **Multi-modal Coherence** - Partially done

## Priority Implementation Order

### 1. Fix Voice Integration (High Priority)
**Why**: Already claimed in v1.2.0 release
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install speech_recognition, pyttsx3, openai-whisper
- [ ] Create WhisperPiperVoice class in whisper_piper.py
- [ ] Connect to TUI voice widget
- [ ] Test with actual voice input
- [ ] Create working demo

### 2. Implement Calculus of Interruption (Medium Priority)
**Why**: Core to consciousness-first philosophy
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `src/nix_for_humanity/core/interruption.py`
- [ ] Define intervention levels (invisible → ambient → inline → active)
- [ ] Implement flow state detection
- [ ] Add smart notification timing
- [ ] Integrate with TUI and CLI

### 3. Add Causal XAI with DoWhy (Medium Priority)
**Why**: Makes system truly explainable
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install DoWhy via poetry
- [ ] Create `src/nix_for_humanity/xai/causal_engine.py`
- [ ] Implement "why" explanations for all operations
- [ ] Add confidence levels to responses
- [ ] Create multi-level explanations (simple → expert)

### 4. Build Conversational Repair (Low Priority)
**Why**: Handles misunderstandings gracefully
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `src/nix_for_humanity/nlp/conversational_repair.py`
- [ ] Implement misunderstanding detection
- [ ] Add clarification mechanisms
- [ ] Build context recovery system
- [ ] Learn from confusion patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Documentation First** ✅ DONE
   - Created PROJECT_STATUS.yaml as single source of truth
   - Updated VERSION to 1.2.0
   - Fixed major inconsistencies in dashboard and roadmap

2. **Verify Voice Actually Works**
   - Current status: Module exists but dependencies missing
   - Need to install and test thoroughly

3. **Implement Missing Phase 3 Features**
   - Start with Calculus of Interruption (most aligned with philosophy)
   - Then Causal XAI (adds real value)
   - Finally Conversational Repair (nice to have)

4. **Test with Real Personas**
   - Once features work, test with representatives
   - Especially important for voice (Grandma Rose)

## Success Criteria for Phase 3 Completion

- [ ] Voice interface works offline with <2s response time
- [ ] System never interrupts inappropriately 
- [ ] All operations have "why" explanations
- [ ] Misunderstandings handled gracefully
- [ ] All 10 personas can use the system comfortably

## Estimated Timeline

- Voice Fix: 2-3 days
- Calculus of Interruption: 3-4 days
- Causal XAI: 4-5 days
- Conversational Repair: 2-3 days
- Testing & Polish: 3-4 days

**Total: ~15-20 days to complete Phase 3 properly**

## Notes

- Documentation chaos was worse than expected
- Many "COMPLETE" claims were aspirational, not actual
- Voice was announced but not fully implemented
- Need better release discipline going forward
