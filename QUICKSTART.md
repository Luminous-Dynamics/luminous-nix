```bash
poetry run ask-nix "install nonexistent-package"
# Returns helpful explanation about package not being found
```

### Quick Performance Mode
For faster responses, use the native Python backend:
```bash
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true
poetry run ask-nix "install vim"
```

## üéØ Common Tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### This is Alpha Software
- Some features are experimental
- Not all NixOS operations are supported yet
- Please report bugs on GitHub

### Performance Varies
- First run may be slower (downloading models)
- Performance depends on your hardware
- Use native backend for best speed

### Privacy First
- Everything runs locally
- No data sent to cloud services
- Your commands stay on your machine

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd luminous-nix
# And in the nix-shell
nix-shell
```

### Poetry Not Found
```bash
# Install poetry if needed
nix-shell -p poetry
```

### Slow Performance
```bash
# Enable native backend
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
poetry install --no-cache
```

## üìö Next Steps

Now that you have Luminous Nix running:

1. **Explore More Commands**: Try natural variations of commands
2. **Read the Docs**: Check [UNIFIED_VISION_AND_REALITY.md](UNIFIED_VISION_AND_REALITY.md) for complete feature list
3. **Try Experimental Features**: Voice interface, learning system (see docs)
4. **Contribute**: Report bugs, suggest features, or contribute code

## üéâ Success!

You're now using natural language to manage NixOS! Remember:
- Be conversational - talk naturally
- Explore freely - it's safe to experiment
- Check docs for advanced features
- Join the community for support
