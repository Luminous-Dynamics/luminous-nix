# Archive Log - 2025-08-24

## Phase 1: Root Directory Cleanup ✅

Archived 220+ files from root directory to `.archive-2025-08-24/`:
- **88 test scripts** (`test_*.py`) → archived to test-scripts/
- **14 demo scripts** (`demo_*.py`) → archived to demo-scripts/  
- **11 integration attempts** → archived to integration-attempts/
- **107 old tools** → archived to old-tools/
- **44 documentation files** → archived to old-docs/
- **Experimental directories**: ai-improvements, paradoxes, pitch, monitoring, paradise

Root directory reduced from 154 Python files to 0 (keeping only setup.py, manage.py in their places).

## Phase 2: Interface Consolidation

### Files in `src/luminous_nix/interfaces/`:
- **cli.py** (322 lines) - Working implementation ✅ KEEP
- **cli_unified.py** - Duplicate attempt → ARCHIVE
- **cli_integrated.py** - Another duplicate → ARCHIVE
- **cli_conscious.py** - Yet another duplicate → ARCHIVE
- **cli_integration_patch.py** - Patch file → ARCHIVE
- **cli.py.backup** - Backup file → ARCHIVE
- **api.py** - API interface ✅ KEEP
- **tui.py** - TUI interface ✅ KEEP
- **voice.py** - Voice interface ✅ KEEP
- **__init__.py** - Module init ✅ KEEP

### Action Taken:
Archiving duplicate CLI implementations, keeping only the working ones.

## Reasoning for Each Archive

### Why These Were Archived:
1. **Test scripts**: Most tested non-existent features (955 tests, only 8% coverage)
2. **Demo scripts**: Experimental demos that aren't part of core functionality
3. **Integration attempts**: Failed or abandoned integration experiments
4. **ai-improvements/**: Experimental AI enhancement attempts
5. **paradoxes/**: Philosophical experiments, not code
6. **pitch/**: Business documents, not code
7. **Old documentation**: Superseded by current docs/ structure

### What We're Keeping:
- Core source code in `src/`
- Working tests in `tests/`
- Current documentation in `docs/`
- Essential config files (pyproject.toml, shell.nix, etc.)
- Build and deployment scripts that work

## Next Phases

- [ ] Phase 3: Clean core module (remove duplicates in src/luminous_nix/core/)
- [ ] Phase 4: Organize consciousness module (40+ files need consolidation)
- [ ] Phase 5: Test rationalization (keep only tests for existing features)

## Recovery Instructions

If any archived file is needed:
```bash
# Single file recovery
cp .archive-2025-08-24/[category]/[filename] .

# Full recovery
cp -r .archive-2025-08-24/* .
```

All archived files are preserved in `.archive-2025-08-24/` with organized subdirectories.
