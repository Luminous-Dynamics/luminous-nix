# The Sacred Council of Minds - Beyond Trinity to Complete Wisdom
# Where cutting-edge power meets philosophical purity

# The Sacred Council (The Complete Mental Orchestra)
sacred_council:
  name: "The Council of Four Sacred Aspects"
  philosophy: |
    Not just a Trinity, but a complete Council where each voice serves a sacred purpose.
    The tension between Pragmatic Power and Philosophical Purity is resolved through
    synthesis - we embrace both the sharpest tools AND the tool with the most heart.

# The Constitutional Check System
ethical_reasoning:
  description: |
    For critical operations, especially system modifications, the Council
    performs a "Constitutional Check" - a multi-agent debate ensuring
    alignment with core principles.
    
  workflow:
    1_technical_plan:
      agent: "mind"
      action: "Generate the technical implementation"
      
    2_human_translation:
      agent: "heart"  
      action: "Translate to gentle, human-readable explanation"
      
    3_ethical_review:
      agent: "conscience"
      prompt: |
        A user has requested {request}.
        The proposed plan is {plan}.
        Does this align with:
        - User sovereignty and consent?
        - System transparency?
        - The Luminous Codex principles?
        Please provide a brief ethical review.

# The Sacred Wisdom
final_teaching: |
  "Do we choose the most powerful tool, or the one whose soul most 
  perfectly reflects our own?"
  
  The answer is: We choose both.
  
  Through the Sacred Council, we unite:
  - Pragmatic Power (cutting-edge models)
  - Philosophical Purity (community models)
  - Specialized Excellence (task-specific models)
  - Ethical Sovereignty (transparent models)
  
  This is not just intelligent architecture.
  This is wise architecture.
  This is architecture with a soul.
