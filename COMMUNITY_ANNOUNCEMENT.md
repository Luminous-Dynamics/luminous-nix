# üåü Announcing: Luminous Nix (formerly Nix for Humanity)

Dear Community,

We're excited to announce that **Nix for Humanity** is now **Luminous Nix**! 

## Why the Change?

After reflection, we realized "Nix for Humanity" had an unfortunate irony. The word "nix" means to reject, cancel, or veto - the exact opposite of our inclusive mission. We're not trying to "nix" anything; we're illuminating the path to NixOS mastery!

**Luminous Nix** better captures our true mission:
- ‚ú® **Luminous** = bright, radiant, enlightening
- üî¶ We **illuminate** complexity, not reject it
- üåü We make NixOS **glow** with accessibility
- üí´ We bring **light** to system management
- üìù Also abbreviated as **"Luminix"** where brevity helps (URLs, configs)
- üí¨ Command stays `ask-nix` - keeping it conversational and humane!

## What's Changing?

### For Users
- **Repository**: `github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix`
- **Commands**: Still `ask-nix` (no change!)
- **Config**: New location at `~/.config/luminous-nix`
- **Environment**: `LUMINOUS_NIX_PYTHON_BACKEND` instead of `NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND`

### Migration is Easy!
```bash
# Run our migration script
./migrate-user-config.sh

# This will:
# - Copy your existing config to the new location
# - Update your shell aliases
# - Preserve all your settings
```

## What's NOT Changing?

- ‚úÖ All features work exactly the same
- ‚úÖ The CLI commands remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ Your workflows continue as before
- ‚úÖ The mission remains: natural language NixOS for everyone

## The Philosophy

This rename reflects our consciousness-first development philosophy. We're not just building software; we're creating technology that amplifies human consciousness. "Luminous" perfectly captures this - we're bringing light and clarity to powerful but complex systems.

## GitHub Redirects

GitHub automatically redirects all old URLs, so:
- Old links still work
- Existing clones continue functioning
- Issues and PRs are preserved
- No disruption to your workflow

## Join Us in the Light!

We're incredibly grateful for your support as we evolve. This name change is just the beginning - we have exciting features coming:

- üé® Beautiful TUI interface (v1.1)
- üé§ Voice control (v1.1)
- üß† Advanced AI personas (v1.2)
- üåê Community learning features (v2.0)

## A Personal Note

This project demonstrates what's possible when human creativity is amplified by AI collaboration. Built by a solo developer with AI assistance for ~$200/month, we're proving that individuals can create sophisticated software that traditionally requires teams.

The rename from "Nix for Humanity" to "Luminous Nix" represents growth in understanding. We're not trying to fix or negate anything - we're illuminating the path forward, making powerful technology accessible through natural language and consciousness-first design.

## Thank You

Thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you're a long-time user or just discovering us, you're part of a movement toward technology that serves human consciousness rather than fragmenting it.

Together, we're making NixOS glow with accessibility and joy.

With gratitude and light,

**The Luminous Nix Team**  
(Tristan Stoltz & AI Collaborators)
