### What is Luminous Nix?

Luminous Nix is a natural language interface for NixOS that makes Linux accessible to everyone. Instead of memorizing complex commands like `nix-env -iA nixos.firefox`, users can simply say "install firefox" and it works.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands plain English commands
- **10x-1500x Performance**: Revolutionary Python-Nix API integration
- **Multiple Personas**: Adapts from beginner (Grandma Rose) to power user
- **100% Local and Private**: No data leaves your machine
- **Error Intelligence**: Errors that actually explain what went wrong
- **Beautiful TUI**: Terminal interface with visualizations

### How to Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix
cd luminous-nix
poetry install
./bin/ask-nix "help"
```

### Common Commands

- `ask-nix "install firefox"` - Install Firefox browser
- `ask-nix "create python dev environment"` - Set up Python development
- `ask-nix "why is my wifi not working?"` - Debug network issues
- `ask-nix "rollback to yesterday"` - Restore previous system state
- `ask-nix "update my system"` - Update all packages
- `ask-nix "search markdown editor"` - Find packages by description
- `ask-nix "show system health"` - Check system status

### Development Story

Built in 2 weeks for $200 using Sacred Trinity Development (Human + Claude + Local LLM), after enterprise consultants quoted $4.2M for the same functionality. This proves what's possible with human-AI collaboration.

### Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Python with native Nix API integration
- **NLP**: Custom intent recognition with persona adaptation  
- **Storage**: Data Trinity (DuckDB, ChromaDB, KÃ¹zu)
- **Learning**: System gets smarter with use
- **Personas**: 10 different user personalities supported

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to know NixOS to use this?**
A: No! That's the whole point. Just describe what you want in plain English.

**Q: Is it really 10x faster?**
A: Yes! We bypass subprocess calls using direct Python-Nix API integration.

**Q: Will this break my system?**
A: No. Everything has --dry-run mode to preview changes before applying.

**Q: Does it work with Home Manager?**
A: Yes! Full Home Manager integration for dotfiles and user packages.

**Q: Is there a GUI?**
A: TUI is working now. Full GUI coming soon.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! Check GitHub for "good first issue" labels.

**Q: What's Sacred Trinity Development?**
A: Our development model: Human (vision) + Claude (architecture) + Local LLM (domain expertise).

**Q: Why is it called Luminous Nix?**
A: Part of the Luminous Dynamics ecosystem - consciousness-first computing.

### Troubleshooting

**Installation fails**: Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and Poetry installed
**Command not found**: Run `poetry shell` first or use `poetry run`
**Import errors**: You need to be in nix-shell for system dependencies
**Permission denied**: Some commands need sudo, bot will tell you
**Slow performance**: Enable Python backend with `export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true`

### Philosophy

Technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around. We believe in making powerful tools accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.
