## 📝 Sample Posts

### The Vulnerability Post
```
Honestly? Luminous Nix is 65% ready.

Critical features work ✅
Some rough edges 🔧
Missing nice-to-haves ⏰

But I'm building in public because perfect is the enemy of shipped.

Here's exactly what works and what doesn't: [link]
```

### The Technical Win
```
BREAKTHROUGH! 🎉

Just eliminated ALL timeout issues in Luminous Nix.

Before: 45s timeout on complex operations 😱
After: 30ms response time ⚡

How? Native Python-Nix API instead of subprocess.

Details: [link]
```

### The Community Ask
```
I need your help 🙏

Testing Luminous Nix's error messages. Which is clearer?

A) "Error: attribute 'fierfox' missing"
B) "Package 'fierfox' not found. Did you mean 'firefox'?"

What other errors confuse you in NixOS?
```

### The Milestone
```
🎉 100 GitHub stars!

When I started Luminous Nix 2 weeks ago, I thought maybe 10 people would care.

Thank you for believing in making NixOS accessible to everyone!

Next milestone: 10 active beta testers. Who wants in?
```

## 🎯 The Goal

Build an engaged community BEFORE launch. When we finally ship:
- 100+ people excited to try it
- 20+ beta testers vouching for it
- 500+ followers watching the journey
- Press aware of the story

The launch becomes inevitable, not forced.

---

## 🌊 Remember

**We're not building in secret and launching with a bang.**
**We're building in public and launching with a community.**

Every day of building is a day of growing our tribe.

Start today. Share something. Anything. Just start.
