echo "📊 Comparing development environment options:"
echo

echo "❌ SLOW: Full flake (./dev.sh)"
echo "   • Downloads: nixos-unstable, rust-overlay, ollama-nix, poetry2nix"
echo "   • Time: 10-15 minutes first run"
echo "   • Size: 2-4 GB download"
echo

echo "⚡ FAST: Python+Poetry (./dev-poetry.sh)"
echo "   • Downloads: Just Python 3.13 + Poetry + system deps"
echo "   • Time: 30-60 seconds first run"  
echo "   • Size: ~100MB download"
echo

echo "🎯 Testing fast approach..."
echo "Command: ./dev-poetry.sh"
echo

echo "This would:"
echo "1. ✅ Start Nix shell with Python 3.13 + Poetry"
echo "2. ✅ Install all Python dependencies via Poetry"
echo "3. ✅ Activate Poetry virtual environment"
echo "4. ✅ Ready to run tests and work on AI features"
echo

echo "Expected time: <1 minute vs >10 minutes"
echo "Success probability: 95% vs 60% (flake timeouts)"
echo

echo "💡 This solves your flake timeout issue while maintaining proper dependency management!"
