# Nix for Humanity

Natural language interface for NixOS. Currently in active development.

## Project Status: Alpha (v0.8.5)

**Working Features** ✅
- Basic CLI with natural language processing
- Package search functionality
- Simple install/remove commands (reliability: ~70%)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Basic intent recognition

**In Development** 🚧
- Native Python-Nix API integration (partially complete)
- TUI interface (UI exists but not fully connected)
- Voice interface (architecture done, integration pending)
- Learning system (saves data but doesn't use it yet)
- Performance optimizations

**Not Yet Implemented** ❌
- Federated learning
- Full persona system (5 of 10 working)
- Community features
- Plugin architecture

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity
cd nix-for-humanity

# Enter development environment
nix develop

# Try the CLI
./bin/ask-nix "help"
./bin/ask-nix "search firefox"
./bin/ask-nix "install vim" --dry-run
```

## Why This Project?

NixOS is powerful but has a steep learning curve. We're building a natural language interface that makes NixOS accessible to everyone - from developers to grandparents.

## Architecture

```
src/nix_humanity/
├── core/       # Natural language processing and execution
├── native/     # Python-Nix API integration (WIP)
├── cli/        # Command-line interface
├── tui/        # Terminal UI (not fully connected)
└── voice/      # Voice interface (planned)
```

## Contributing

We need help! The project has ambitious goals but currently only ~25% of envisioned features are working.

**Priority Areas:**
1. Fix reliability of install/remove commands
2. Complete native Python-Nix API integration
3. Connect the TUI to the backend
4. Write real integration tests (not mocks)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Check what actually works
./scripts/functionality-check.sh

# Validate performance claims
python scripts/validate-performance.py
```

## Performance

**Current Performance:**
- Package search: 2-5 seconds
- Install command: 3-10 seconds (when it works)
- Response time: Variable

**Target Performance:**
- All operations < 0.5 seconds
- 10x improvement with native API (partially achieved)

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current) - Foundation
- [x] Basic CLI functionality
- [x] Intent recognition
- [ ] Reliable command execution
- [ ] Native API integration

### Phase 2 - Core Features
- [ ] Voice interface
- [ ] Learning system activation
- [ ] TUI full integration
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Phase 3 - Production
- [ ] All 10 personas working
- [ ] Community features
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] 1.0 release

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Honest communication** about what works and what doesn't
- **Privacy first** - all processing happens locally
- **Accessibility** - technology should work for everyone
- **Continuous improvement** - ship small, iterate often

## Acknowledgments

Built using the "Sacred Trinity" development model - a unique collaboration between human, AI, and local LLM that achieves remarkable results on a $200/month budget.

# Documentation Migration Guide

## Current State

The documentation describes an ambitious vision, but only ~25% is implemented.

## Migration Plan

### 1. Archive Vision Documents
Move all aspirational documents to `docs/archive/vision/`:
- Documents describing unimplemented features
- Roadmaps for features not yet started
- Technical specs for future components

### 2. Update Core Documents
Rewrite to reflect reality:
- README.md - What actually works today
- QUICKSTART.md - Steps that actually succeed
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Current implementation only

### 3. Mark WIP Features
For partially implemented features:
- Add "🚧 UNDER DEVELOPMENT" badges
- Include "Current Status" sections
- List specific working/broken parts

### 4. Create Honest Metrics
Replace aspirational metrics with real ones:
- Actual performance numbers
- Real success rates
- Current limitations

## Documentation Standards

### For Implemented Features
- Include working examples
- Show actual output
- List known issues

### For Planned Features
- Move to ROADMAP.md
- Mark clearly as "PLANNED"
- No promises on timeline

### For Partial Features
- List what works
- List what doesn't
- Be specific about reliability

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Does this document describe reality?
- [ ] Can a new user follow these steps successfully?
- [ ] Are performance claims backed by measurements?
- [ ] Are limitations clearly stated?
- [ ] Is the vision separated from current state?
