## üöÄ Key Insight

We have a PHENOMENAL performance story (9064x faster!) that nobody knows about. 
Week 3 is about making our strengths visible while systematically fixing the 
basics that users actually touch.

**Remember**: Fast software feels magical. Let's make sure users can experience 
that magic from their very first command.
