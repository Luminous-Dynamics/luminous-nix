Voice Interface Proof of Concept for Nix for Humanity

This demonstrates how voice could revolutionize NixOS interaction:
- Natural speech input
- Real-time transcription
- Intent recognition
- Voice feedback

Requirements:
    poetry add speechrecognition pyaudio pyttsx3

    🎤 Voice Interface Concept Demo
    ================================
    
    Imagine saying:
    
    User: "Hey Nix, install Firefox"
    Nix:  "I'll install Firefox for you. This will update your system 
           configuration. Should I proceed?"
    User: "Yes, go ahead"
    Nix:  "Installing Firefox... Done! Firefox is now available in your
           applications menu."
    
    User: "Nix, what changed in my last update?"
    Nix:  "Your last update on Tuesday included: Security patches for
           OpenSSL, Firefox updated to version 122, and 3 Python packages
           were updated."
    
    User: "Roll back to yesterday"
    Nix:  "I'll roll back to generation 42 from yesterday at 3 PM.
           This will undo today's Firefox installation. Proceed?"
    User: "Yes"
    Nix:  "System rolled back successfully."

    🚀 Next Steps:
    
    1. Add dependencies:
       poetry add speechrecognition pyaudio pyttsx3 openai-whisper
    
    2. Create voice module:
       src/nix_for_humanity/interfaces/voice.py
    
    3. Integrate with TUI:
       Add waveform widget to ConsciousnessOrb
    
    4. Test with users:
       Start with English, expand to other languages
    
    This is the future of human-computer interaction!
