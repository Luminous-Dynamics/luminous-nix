## Executive Summary

- **Current Coverage**: {analysis_result['total_coverage']:.1f}%
- **Target Coverage**: 95.0%
- **Gap to Target**: {analysis_result['target_gap']:.1f}%
- **Status**: {analysis_result['status']}

## Testing Foundation Progress

Our Testing Foundation initiative aims to solidify the codebase with 95% test coverage. Here's our current progress:

### ✅ Completed Milestones
- [x] Performance Regression Tests (Native Python-Nix Interface validation)
- [x] Persona-based E2E Tests (All 10 personas validated)
- [x] Security Boundary Tests (17 tests, 6 issues identified)
- [x] Coverage Monitoring Infrastructure (Automated reporting)

### 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Unit Test Coverage Improvements
- [ ] Integration Test Expansion
- [ ] Critical Path Test Coverage

    else:

    report_content += f"""
### Testing Strategy

Our approach follows the testing pyramid:
- **60% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated component testing
- **30% Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **10% E2E Tests**: Complete user journey validation

### Quality Gates

- ✅ **Security**: 17 security boundary tests implemented
- ✅ **Performance**: Native API performance regression tests
- ✅ **Accessibility**: 10-persona validation tests
- ✅ **Privacy**: Local-first data protection tests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Address files with <50% coverage
2. **Integration Focus**: Expand CLI ↔ Backend communication tests
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Add error condition and boundary tests
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated coverage regression detection

## Sacred Principles

Every test is written with consciousness-first principles:
- Tests serve as documentation for future developers
- Coverage serves users, not just metrics
- Quality over quantity in test design
- Testing as an act of compassion for maintainers

*"Testing is not about catching bugs - it's about building confidence, for users and developers alike."* 🌊

**Testing Foundation Status**: {analysis_result['status']}
**Journey Progress**: {analysis_result['total_coverage']:.1f}% → 95.0%
**Sacred Commitment**: Every test is an act of love for users and future maintainers
