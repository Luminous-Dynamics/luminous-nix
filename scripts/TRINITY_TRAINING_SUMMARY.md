# Sacred Trinity Training Summary

## What We've Discovered

### The Ollama Limitation
After extensive testing, we discovered that **Ollama modelfiles only set system prompts** - they don't actually fine-tune or train the base models. This means:

1. Base models (mistral, llama3.2, etc.) have no built-in NixOS knowledge
2. System prompts alone can't provide factual knowledge
3. Models will hallucinate incorrect NixOS answers

### What We've Accomplished

#### âœ… Successfully Implemented:
1. **Multi-Model Training System** (`sacred-trinity-trainer-v2.py`)
   - Creates 4 specialized models (expert, empathy, coder, quick)
   - SQLite tracking of training progress
   - Automated modelfile generation

2. **Knowledge Collection Pipeline** (`collect-usage-data.sh`)
   - Interactive Q&A collection
   - Batch import from files
   - Usage statistics tracking

3. **Model Selection Interface** (`ask-trinity`)
   - Automatically selects appropriate model based on query
   - Falls back gracefully when models unavailable

4. **NixOS Knowledge Base**
   - 15 Q&A pairs collected and stored
   - Covers essential NixOS operations
   - Structured for easy expansion

#### ðŸš§ In Progress:
1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Solution**
   - `sacred-trinity-trainer-rag.py` - Retrieves relevant Q&A examples
   - Injects examples into prompts for context
   - SQLite database for fast retrieval

### Current Status

We have 4 trained models that understand they should be NixOS experts, but they lack actual NixOS knowledge. The models are:

1. `nix-expert-20250726_1551` (mistral:7b-instruct based)
2. `nix-empathy-20250726_1551` (llama3.2:3b based)
3. `nix-coder-20250726_1551` (qwen2.5:3b based)
4. `nix-quick-20250726_1551` (tinyllama:1.1b based)

### Solutions Being Explored

#### 1. RAG Approach (Most Promising)
Instead of training, retrieve relevant Q&A pairs and include them in the prompt:
```
Based on these NixOS examples:
Q: How do I install Firefox?
A: Edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and add firefox to systemPackages...

Now answer: How do I install Chrome?
```

#### 2. True Fine-Tuning (Future)
- Use tools like LoRA or QLoRA for actual model fine-tuning
- Requires more compute and different tooling
- Would create models with embedded NixOS knowledge

#### 3. Hybrid Approach
- Use a model that already has Linux/tech knowledge
- Combine with RAG for NixOS-specific information
- Provide clear instructions about NixOS vs other distros

### Lessons Learned

1. **Ollama is great for inference, not training** - It's designed for running models, not creating them
2. **System prompts have limits** - They can change tone/style but not add factual knowledge
3. **RAG is powerful** - Retrieving relevant examples at query time is more effective than prompts
4. **Local LLMs need help** - Without specific training, they don't know NixOS

### Next Steps

1. **Complete RAG implementation** - Fix the import issues and test thoroughly
2. **Expand knowledge base** - Collect more Q&A pairs from documentation
3. **Test with users** - See if RAG provides good enough answers
4. **Consider alternatives** - Look into models pretrained on Linux/NixOS content

### Sacred Trinity Workflow Benefits

Despite the training limitations, the Sacred Trinity workflow has proven valuable:

1. **Human** provides real user needs and testing
2. **Claude** builds sophisticated systems quickly
3. **Local LLM** can still help with general Linux/programming questions

The $200/month development model remains valid - we just need to adjust our approach to local LLM usage.
