# Integration Summary for Temp Documents

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Integrated By**: Claude Code

## Documents Integrated

### 1. Blueprint for Generative Systems
- **Original**: docs/Temp/Blueprint for Generative Systems.md
- **Integrated Into**: docs/02-ARCHITECTURE/13-GENERATIVE-SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Content**: 6-layer architecture, Actor Model, DLT auditing layer

### 2. Blueprint for Legible Digital Worlds
- **Original**: docs/Temp/Blueprint for Legible Digital Worlds.md
- **Integrated Into**: docs/02-ARCHITECTURE/14-COGNITIVE-INTERFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Content**: Cognitive systems engineering, scaffolding levels, learning phases

### 3. Designing Luminous Nix Interfaces
- **Original**: docs/Temp/Designing Luminous Nix Interfaces.md
- **Integrated Into**: docs/02-ARCHITECTURE/15-MULTIMODAL-INTERACTION-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Content**: Multi-modal interaction theory, Unified Interaction Grammar

### 4. Evolving AI for Collective Wisdom
- **Original**: docs/Temp/Evolving AI for Collective Wisdom.md
- **Integrated Into**: Multiple architecture documents
- **Content**: Federated learning, temporal knowledge graphs, skill evolution

## Integration Approach

These strategic documents contained valuable architectural insights that were:
1. Extracted and synthesized into actionable architecture guides
2. Formatted consistently with existing documentation
3. Cross-referenced with other architecture components
4. Made discoverable through the main architecture index

## Value Captured

- **Actor Model** implementation details for distributed computation
- **RDF/Linked Data** principles for semantic interoperability  
- **Cognitive Scaffolding** framework for progressive mastery
- **Unified Interaction Grammar** with 7 core semantic verbs
- **Multi-modal coherence** across CLI, TUI, and VUI interfaces
- **Federated learning** architecture for community intelligence

These concepts are now permanent parts of the Luminous Nix architecture documentation.
