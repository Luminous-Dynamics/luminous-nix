**ðŸŽ‰ Announcing Luminous Nix v0.1.0-alpha!**

Hey NixOS community! I'm excited to share my project - a natural language interface for NixOS.

**What it does:**
â€¢ Talk to NixOS in plain English
â€¢ `ask-nix "install firefox"` - it just works
â€¢ `ask-nix fix` - AI diagnoses and repairs your system
â€¢ 2-minute setup, works offline after

**The interesting part:**
Built this in 2 weeks using Claude Code (AI pair programmer). Total cost: ~$200/month in AI tools. It's a new development paradigm - solo dev + AI = small team productivity.

**Try it:**
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix/main/install.sh | sh
```

Would love your feedback! This is alpha so expect rough edges, but the core works.
