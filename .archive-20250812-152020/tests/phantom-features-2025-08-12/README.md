# 🗄️ Phantom Features Test Archive

**Archived**: 2025-08-12
**Reason**: These tests were written for features that never existed

## 📊 The Problem

These tests created false 95% coverage when reality was 8%. They tested:
- Features that were never built
- Mocked implementations instead of real code
- Aspirational functionality
- Research concepts that weren't implemented

## 🎯 Testing Golden Rule

> "Test what IS, build what WILL BE, document what WAS"

## 📁 What's Archived Here

### TUI Tests
- Terminal UI that was never fully implemented
- Voice widgets that don't exist
- Comprehensive UI tests for partial features

### Learning System Tests
- DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) - never built
- User preference learning - not implemented
- Symbiotic intelligence - research concept only
- Federated learning - future vision

### Knowledge Base Tests
- Advanced knowledge engine - partial implementation
- Comprehensive knowledge features - don't exist

### Coverage Tests
- Meta-tests that tested test coverage of phantom features
- Created recursive false confidence

### Advanced Features
- v1.1 features that were never built
- Performance breakthroughs that didn't happen
- Enhanced responses that aren't implemented

## 💡 Future Use

These tests may be valuable when/if these features are actually built.
Until then, they are misleading and harmful to project clarity.

## ✅ What to Do Instead

1. Build the feature first
2. Write tests WITH the feature
3. Never test aspirational functionality
4. Be honest about coverage
