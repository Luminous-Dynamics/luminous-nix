## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter environment
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity
cd nix-for-humanity
nix develop

# Enable native performance (10x faster!)
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true

# Start using natural language
./bin/ask-nix "install firefox"
./bin/ask-nix "search for text editors"
./bin/ask-nix "show my generations"

# Launch the beautiful TUI
./bin/nix-tui

# Get help anytime
./bin/ask-nix "help"
```

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
# Natural language works
ask-nix "I need a web browser"
ask-nix "update my system please"
ask-nix "what packages do I have installed?"

# Educational error handling
ask-nix "install nonexistent"
# Returns helpful explanation about package search

# Different personality styles
ask-nix --personality technical "explain flakes"
ask-nix --personality encouraging "help me get started"
```

## 🎓 Educational Errors

When something goes wrong, we help you learn:

```
❌ I couldn't find the package 'neovmi' in the NixOS repositories.

🎓 Understanding NixOS Packages
Sometimes packages have different names than expected.

Suggestions:
• Did you mean 'neovim'?
• Search with: nix search nixpkgs neovim
• Check https://search.nixos.org

Would you like me to search for similar packages?
```

## 📊 Performance

All operations complete in **<0.5 seconds**, with most under **0.1 seconds**:

- Package search: ~50ms
- Generation listing: ~10ms  
- Configuration validation: ~100ms
- Natural language parsing: ~20ms

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **100% Local** - All processing on your machine
- **No Telemetry** - We don't track anything
- **Safe Execution** - Commands are validated before running
- **Open Source** - Audit the code yourself

## 📦 What's NOT in v1.0

We've intentionally postponed some features to ensure v1.0 is rock-solid:

- Voice interface (coming in v2.0)
- Advanced AI learning (v3.0)
- Multi-modal interfaces (v2.0)
- Federated learning (v4.0)
