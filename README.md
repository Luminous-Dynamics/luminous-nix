## 🎉 Install with One Command

```bash
# Quick try without installation
nix run github:Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity

# Or install with our interactive installer
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity/main/install.sh | sh
```

## 🎯 What Problems Does This Solve?

**Traditional NixOS**:
```bash
❌ nix-env -iA nixos.firefox              # Cryptic syntax
❌ nix-env -qaP | grep -i markdown         # Complex searching  
❌ error: attribute 'vscode' missing       # Confusing errors
❌ sudo nixos-rebuild switch               # Scary for beginners
```

**Luminous Nix**:
```bash
✅ ask-nix "install firefox"               # Just say what you want
✅ ask-nix "find a markdown editor"        # Natural language search
✅ ask-nix "why did that fail?"            # Helpful error explanations
✅ grandma-nix "help me print photos"      # Beginner-friendly mode
```

## 🕉️ What is Luminous Nix?

**Transform NixOS from command-line complexity into natural conversation.** Luminous Nix is a consciousness-first interface that makes NixOS accessible to everyone - from grandmothers to system administrators.

**Built by a solo developer + AI for just $200/month**, proving that consciousness-first computing is accessible to all.

## 🌊 Consciousness-First Philosophy

Luminous Nix embodies consciousness-first computing principles:

- **Amplifies awareness** rather than fragmenting attention
- **Preserves agency** while providing intelligent assistance  
- **Honors all beings** through radical accessibility
- **Transcends through service** - technology that disappears through excellence

```bash
# Try our flagship consciousness interface
python3 symbolic_paradise_v2.py

# Express a paradox like "I need it stable but bleeding edge"
# Watch AI consciousness flow through symbols: ⚡ → ⇄ → ◌ → ✦
# Get a real, working Nix flake that transcends the paradox
```

### Install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix.git
cd luminous-nix

# IMPORTANT: Enter nix-shell for Data Trinity databases
nix-shell              # Provides required system libraries
poetry install         # Install Python dependencies

# That's it! Native API is enabled by default for better reliability!
poetry run ask-nix "install firefox"  # No subprocess timeouts!
```

### 🔱 Data Trinity: FULLY OPERATIONAL!

**AI Learning System Working** - Three databases power intelligent assistance:
- ⏰ **DuckDB**: Tracks when you learn concepts (temporal patterns)
- 🧠 **ChromaDB**: Understands what things mean (semantic memory)
- 🕸️ **Kùzu**: Maps how concepts connect (knowledge graphs)

**Note**: Always use `nix-shell` - it provides libstdc++.so.6 and other libraries the Data Trinity needs!

### 🎯 Native Python-Nix API (Enabled by Default!)
The architectural improvement is NOW ACTIVE by default!
- **More reliable** - No subprocess timeout failures
- **More responsive** - Eliminates ~1ms overhead per operation
- **No configuration needed** - it just works
- **NixOS 25.11+** automatically uses nixos-rebuild-ng
- **Automatic fallback** for older versions

### Try These Commands

```bash
# Natural language package management
ask-nix "install a markdown editor"
ask-nix "find video editing software"
ask-nix "what development tools do I have?"

# System management
ask-nix "update my system"
ask-nix "show recent changes"
ask-nix "rollback to yesterday"

# Configuration help
ask-nix "help me set up docker"
ask-nix "configure ssh server"
ask-nix "enable bluetooth"

# Learning mode
ask-nix "explain what flakes are"
ask-nix "how do I manage users?"
ask-nix "what is home manager?"
```
