cd nix-for-humanity
nix develop

# Enable native performance (10x faster!)
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true

# Start using natural language
./bin/ask-nix "install firefox"
./bin/ask-nix "search for text editors"
./bin/ask-nix "show my generations"

# Get help anytime
./bin/ask-nix "help"
```

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
# Natural language works
ask-nix "I need a web browser"
ask-nix "update my system please"
ask-nix "what packages do I have installed?"

# Educational error handling
ask-nix "install nonexistent"
# Returns helpful explanation about package search

# Different personality styles
ask-nix --personality technical "explain flakes"
ask-nix --personality encouraging "help me get started"
```

## 🎓 Educational Errors

When something goes wrong, we help you learn:

```
❌ I couldn't find the package 'neovmi' in the NixOS repositories.

🎓 Understanding NixOS Packages
Sometimes packages have different names than expected.

Suggestions:
• Did you mean 'neovim'?
• Search with: nix search nixpkgs neovim
• Check https://search.nixos.org

Would you like me to search for similar packages?
```

## 📊 Performance
