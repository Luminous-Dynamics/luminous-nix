# License Comparison: MIT vs Custom SRL

## Considerations for a Custom License

### Potential Advantages of SRL (Custom License)

1. **Philosophical Alignment**
   - Could embed "for humanity" principles directly
   - Might include provisions for accessibility
   - Could protect against uses that harm users
   - May ensure contributions benefit everyone

2. **Project-Specific Terms**
   - Required accessibility compliance
   - Protection of user privacy/sovereignty
   - Commitment to open development
   - Anti-dark-pattern clauses

3. **Community Values**
   - Could encode Code of Conduct principles
   - Might require derivative works to remain accessible
   - Could ensure "invisible excellence" philosophy continues

### Challenges with Custom Licenses

1. **Adoption Barriers**
   - Legal departments unfamiliar with it
   - Developers hesitant about unknown terms
   - May limit corporate contributions
   - Could reduce integration opportunities

2. **Legal Complexity**
   - Needs professional legal review
   - May have unforeseen loopholes
   - International compatibility issues
   - Enforcement difficulties

3. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Requires ongoing legal support
   - May need updates over time
   - Community must understand it
   - Documentation overhead

## Recommendation Framework

Use **SRL (Custom)** if it:
- ✅ Has been legally reviewed
- ✅ Is simple enough for users to understand
- ✅ Doesn't create adoption barriers
- ✅ Meaningfully protects the project's values
- ✅ Has clear, enforceable terms

Use **MIT** if:
- ✅ Maximum adoption is critical
- ✅ Legal simplicity is valued
- ✅ NixOS ecosystem compatibility matters
- ✅ Philosophy can be maintained through community norms
- ✅ Commercial adoption is important

## Hybrid Approach Option

Consider using:
- **MIT** for core code (maximum adoption)
- **SRL** for brand/trademark (protect philosophy)
- **Community guidelines** for values (non-legal)

This gives legal clarity while maintaining philosophical integrity.

## Questions to Consider

1. What specific protections does the SRL provide?
2. Has it been reviewed by a lawyer familiar with open source?
3. Would it prevent any legitimate uses?
4. How would the Nix community receive it?
5. Does it add meaningful protection beyond MIT + Code of Conduct?

## Conclusion

Without seeing the specific SRL terms, I can't make a definitive recommendation. However, if the SRL:
- Is legally sound
- Doesn't impede adoption
- Meaningfully protects the project's human-centric values
- Has been vetted by the community

Then it could indeed be better than MIT for this project.

The key test: Does the license serve humanity by protecting the project's values while remaining accessible to all who would use it for good?
