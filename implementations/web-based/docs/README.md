## üéØ Key Concepts

### The Vision
Transform NixOS from an expert-only system to one that anyone can use through natural conversation.

### The Approach
- **Radical Simplicity**: One input field, infinite possibilities
- **Voice First**: Accessible to everyone, including those who can't see
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works on 2GB RAM, scales to any hardware
- **Local First**: Your data, your computer, your control
- **Invisible Excellence**: The best interface disappears

### The Philosophy
Technology should:
- Protect attention, not extract it
- Support growth, not create dependence
- Respect users, not manipulate them
- Become invisible, not indispensable
