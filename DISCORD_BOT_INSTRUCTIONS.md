# ü§ñ Automated Discord Setup - 3 Methods

## Method 1: Discord Bot (Most Powerful)

### Step 1: Create Bot (3 minutes)
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application" ‚Üí Name it "Luminous Setup Bot"
3. Go to "Bot" section ‚Üí "Add Bot"
4. Copy the token
5. Under "OAuth2" ‚Üí "URL Generator":
   - Scopes: `bot` + `applications.commands`
   - Permissions: `Administrator`
6. Copy the generated URL and open it
7. Add bot to a test server

### Step 2: Run Setup Script
```bash
# Install discord.py
pip install discord.py

# Edit discord_bot_setup.py and add your token
nano discord_bot_setup.py
# Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token

# Run the bot
python discord_bot_setup.py
```

The bot will automatically:
- Create all channels
- Set up roles
- Post welcome messages
- Generate invite links

## Method 2: Discord.js Template (Web-Based)

### Use Discord Bot Maker
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create app and bot as above
3. Use this template generator: https://discordjs.guide/

### Or Use Botrix (No Code)
1. Go to https://botrix.cc/
2. Sign in with Discord
3. Use their visual builder to:
   - Create channels
   - Set up auto-roles
   - Add welcome messages
4. Deploy instantly

## Method 3: Community Templates (Instant)

### Use Pre-made Templates
1. Go to Discord
2. Create server ‚Üí "Start from template"
3. Search "Developer Community" or "Open Source"
4. Customize the template:
   - Rename to "Luminous Nix"
   - Adjust channels
   - Add your content

### Or Clone Existing Servers
1. Find similar project Discord (NixOS, Linux, etc.)
2. Use "Server Settings" ‚Üí "Server Template"
3. Create template link
4. Apply to your server

## üöÄ Fastest Option: Discord API via Postman

### Quick API Setup
1. Get your user token (F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí look for "authorization")
2. Use Postman or curl to create server:

```bash
# Create server
curl -X POST https://discord.com/api/v9/guilds \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Luminous Nix | Natural Language NixOS",
    "icon": null,
    "channels": [
      {"name": "welcome", "type": 0},
      {"name": "general", "type": 0},
      {"name": "help", "type": 0},
      {"name": "bugs", "type": 0}
    ],
    "system_channel_id": 0
  }'
```

## üéØ My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### Step 1: Manual Quick Create (2 min)
1. Create basic server manually
2. Add 5 essential channels

### Step 2: Bot Enhancement (5 min)
1. Add MEE6 bot: https://mee6.xyz
2. Add Carl-bot: https://carl-bot.com
3. They'll handle:
   - Auto-roles
   - Welcome messages
   - Moderation
   - Custom commands

### Step 3: Community Building
Post in launch:
"Discord is basic but functional! Who wants to help make it awesome?"

## üî• The "Launch First" Method

Just create a basic server with:
- #general
- #help
- Invite link

Post in HN:
"Discord: [link] (bare bones - help us build it!)"

**People LOVE helping build communities from scratch!**

## üìù Emergency Templates

### If you have 30 seconds:
1. Create server
2. Post this in #general:
```
Welcome! We're setting this up live during launch!
Luminous Nix: Natural language for NixOS
GitHub: [link]
Help us organize this Discord!
```

### Auto-Message for New Members:
```
Welcome! You're early! 
We're literally building this Discord during our HN launch.
Grab a role, suggest channels, help us grow!
You're not just joining a server, you're building it!
```

## üé™ The Meta Move

**Make Discord setup part of the launch story:**

"We're so focused on making NixOS accessible that we forgot to make our Discord accessible! First 10 people to help set it up become founding moderators!"

This turns a limitation into engagement!

**Remember**: Perfect Discord < Launched Product

A basic Discord with engaged founders beats a perfect Discord with absent founders!
