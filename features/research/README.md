## What Lives Here

These are experimental research components that explore advanced concepts in consciousness-first computing. They represent bold ideas that may or may not make it into production but advance our understanding of what's possible.

## Components Preserved

### Phenomenology Research
- **phenomenology/** - First-person experience modeling
  - Interactive phenomenology demos
  - Qualia dashboard experiments
  - ActivityWatch integration for behavior modeling
  - Consciousness state tracking

### Symbiotic Intelligence
- **symbiotic/** - Human-AI partnership research
  - Trust engine experiments
  - Co-evolution models
  - Mutual growth patterns

### Consciousness Research
- **consciousness/** - Advanced consciousness metrics
  - Flow state detection algorithms
  - Attention preservation models
  - Digital wellbeing frameworks

### Experimental Tools
- **experimental/** - Cutting-edge prototypes
  - Research progress tracking
  - Novel interaction paradigms
  - Speculative features

## Research Philosophy

These components embody:
- **Radical experimentation** - Try wild ideas
- **Fast failure** - Learn quickly what doesn't work
- **Deep insight** - Understand fundamental principles
- **Future vision** - Imagine what could be

## Integration Approach

Research components may:
1. Graduate to v2.0+ features after validation
2. Inform design decisions without direct implementation
3. Remain as reference implementations
4. Inspire community contributions

## Ethical Considerations

All research follows principles of:
- User consent and transparency
- Privacy preservation
- Beneficial outcomes
- Reversible experiments
