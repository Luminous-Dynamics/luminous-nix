## What Lives Here

These components represent the cutting edge of AI research integrated into Nix for Humanity. They implement sophisticated cognitive models, trust engines, and consciousness-aware computing patterns.

## Components Preserved

### Symbiotic Knowledge Graph (Advanced Features)
- **knowledge_graph/** - Four-dimensional knowledge representation
  - Ontological Layer - NixOS concepts and relationships
  - Episodic Layer - User interaction history
  - Phenomenological Layer - User states and preferences
  - Metacognitive Layer - System self-awareness

### Consciousness Metrics & Monitoring
- **consciousness_metrics/** - Advanced user state tracking
  - Digital wellbeing scores
  - Flow state detection
  - Attention preservation metrics
  - Cognitive load monitoring

### Sacred Development Patterns
- **sacred_development/** - Meta-reflexive development practices
  - Consciousness-first design patterns
  - Kairos time implementation
  - Sacred pause mechanisms
  - Meta-reflexive evolution

### Theory of Mind Implementation
- **metrics_collector.py** - Advanced behavioral pattern recognition
- **performance_dashboard.py** - Real-time consciousness monitoring
- **research_config.py** - Configuration for experimental features

### Testing Infrastructure
- **mocks/** - Mock implementations for research components
  - Allows testing without full implementation
  - Preserves research interfaces

## Why Preserved for v3.0

These components represent:
- Deep AI research requiring extensive validation
- Complex cognitive models needing refinement
- Experimental features requiring real-world testing
- Advanced patterns that build on stable v1.0 and v2.0 foundations

## Research Foundations

Based on:
- CASA (Computers As Social Actors) paradigm
- Theory of Mind cognitive models
- Consciousness-first computing principles
- Symbiotic intelligence research

## Integration Path

When ready for v3.0:
1. Ensure v1.0 and v2.0 features are rock-solid
2. Validate research hypotheses with user testing
3. Implement gradual feature flags
4. Monitor consciousness metrics carefully
5. Iterate based on real-world usage

## Technical Considerations

- Requires significant computational resources
- Needs careful privacy considerations
- Must handle edge cases gracefully
- Requires extensive testing across personas

## Philosophical Notes

These components embody the vision of technology that:
- Understands and adapts to user consciousness
- Preserves agency while providing intelligence
- Creates genuine partnership, not dependency
- Evolves with users over time
