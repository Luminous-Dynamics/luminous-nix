    "Fair question! Here's a live demo: [asciinema link]. The code is at https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix - try it yourself!",
    "I understand the skepticism. Check out the working code and demo. It really does work!",
    "Valid concern! That's why it's open source. See for yourself: [GitHub link]"

  "how_different": [
    "Great question! Unlike [X], we use natural language, have 10x-1500x performance via native API, and adapt to user skill level.",
    "Main differences: No command memorization, native Python-Nix API for speed, and personas from beginner to expert.",
    "We focus on accessibility. Your grandma can use this. That's the difference."
  ],
  "technical": [
    "We bypass subprocess entirely using Python-Nix native bindings. Details in our architecture doc: [link]",
    "The key insight was eliminating subprocess overhead. Direct API calls = 10x-1500x speedup.",
    "Happy to dive deep! The magic is in src/luminous_nix/core/backend.py - native Nix integration."
