# Documentation Reorganization Plan for Luminous Nix

## 🎯 Goal: Clear, Honest, and Useful Documentation

Transform the current maze of aspirational documents into a clear, practical guide that accurately represents what Luminous Nix is and does.

## 📋 Immediate Actions

### 1. Create Core Reality Documents

- Move current philosophical content to `docs/philosophy/`
- Focus on: What it is, what works, how to use it
- Include clear alpha/beta warnings
- Remove mystical language from main description

#### `/UNIFIED_VISION_AND_REALITY.md` ✅ (Created)
- Single source of truth for project status
- Clear separation of working/developing/planned
- Honest metrics and limitations

#### `/QUICKSTART.md` - 5-Minute Success
```markdown

    │
    └── archive/               # Old/outdated docs
        └── [move conflicting docs here]
```

### 3. Update Existing Documentation

#### Fix Broken References
- Remove references to non-existent `REALITY_VS_VISION.md`
- Update links to point to `UNIFIED_VISION_AND_REALITY.md`
- Fix paths in docs/README.md navigation

#### Clarify Feature Status
For each feature mentioned, add status badges:
- 🟢 **Production Ready** - Use freely
- 🟡 **Experimental** - Works but may change
- 🔴 **Planned** - Not yet implemented
- 🟠 **Deprecated** - Being removed

#### Reduce Philosophical Overhead
- Move heavy consciousness/sacred content to `docs/philosophy/`
- Keep main docs focused on practical usage
- Add "Philosophy" section at end for interested readers

### 4. Create Missing Critical Documents

#### `/docs/user/troubleshooting.md`
- Common issues and solutions
- How to report bugs effectively
- Debug mode and logging

#### `/docs/features/working/STATUS.md`
- Detailed status of each feature
- Test coverage per component
- Known limitations

#### `/docs/technical/PERFORMANCE.md`
- Benchmark results
- Performance tips
- Comparison with alternatives

## 📊 Documentation Quality Standards

### Every Document Must Have:
1. **Status Badge** - Alpha/Beta/Stable
2. **Last Updated** - Date of last revision
3. **Read Time** - Estimated reading time
4. **Prerequisites** - What you need to know first
5. **Related Docs** - Where to go next

### Writing Style Guidelines:
- **Be Honest** - Say what doesn't work
- **Be Practical** - Focus on usage over theory
- **Be Clear** - No unnecessary jargon
- **Be Helpful** - Anticipate user needs
- **Be Humble** - Acknowledge limitations
