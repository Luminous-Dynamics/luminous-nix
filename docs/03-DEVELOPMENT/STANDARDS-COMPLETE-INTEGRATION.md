## 🛠️ Daily Workflow Integration

### Session Start (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/nix-for-humanity

# Quick sacred review
./scripts/sacred-review.sh quick

# Note focus for session
echo "Today's focus: [specific area]" >> .claude/session-notes.md
```

### During Development
```bash
# Before committing - run pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

# Quick format fix
poetry run black .
poetry run ruff check --fix .

# Check types
poetry run mypy src/ --strict
```

### Session End
```bash
# Quick check of what was done
git status
git diff --stat

# Update session notes
echo "Improvements made: ..." >> .claude/session-notes.md
```

## 📅 Weekly Rhythm

### Sunday Evening Sacred Review (15-30 min)
```bash
# Run the sacred review
./scripts/sacred-review.sh weekly

# Review the generated dashboard
open dashboard.html  # or xdg-open on Linux

# Set intentions for week
vim .claude/session-notes.md
```

### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# CI/CD runs on every PR automatically
# Dependabot updates weekly (Monday 4 AM)
# Performance tests run Sunday 2 AM
```

## 🎯 Quick Reference Card

### Fix Common Issues
```bash
# Format all Python files
poetry run black .

# Fix linting issues
poetry run ruff check --fix .

# Sort imports
poetry run isort .

# Run all pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Generate Reports
```bash
# Real-time monitor
./scripts/monitor_standards.sh

# Metrics dashboard
python scripts/metrics_dashboard.py

# Weekly report
python scripts/generate_weekly_report.py

# Sacred review menu
./scripts/sacred-review.sh menu
```

### Check Specific Standards
```bash
# Test coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=nix_for_humanity

# Type checking
poetry run mypy src/ --strict

# Security scan
poetry run bandit -r src/

# Complexity analysis
poetry run radon cc src/ -s
```

## 📈 Success Metrics Tracking

### What We Measure
| Metric | Target | Check Command |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥90% | `poetry run pytest --cov` |
| Type Coverage | 100% | `poetry run mypy --strict` |
| Lint Issues | 0 | `poetry run ruff check` |
| Format | 100% | `poetry run black --check` |
| Security | 0 HIGH | `poetry run bandit -r src/` |
| Complexity | <10 | `poetry run radon cc src/` |
| Cold Start | <3s | `python scripts/metrics_dashboard.py` |

### Automated Tracking
- **Every PR**: Standards compliance check via GitHub Actions
- **Weekly**: Performance benchmarks and report generation
- **Monthly**: Trend analysis and standards evolution

## 🌊 The Sacred Flow

### How Standards Support Consciousness
1. **Automatic Formatting** = No mental energy on style
2. **Type Checking** = Catch errors before they manifest
3. **CI/CD Automation** = Trust in consistent quality
4. **Monitoring** = Awareness without constant checking
5. **Sacred Review** = Intentional improvement rhythm

### The Invisible Excellence
When working well, you won't think about standards - they'll just be there:
- Code formats itself
- Types guide development
- Tests run automatically
- Quality maintains itself
- Reviews become celebration
