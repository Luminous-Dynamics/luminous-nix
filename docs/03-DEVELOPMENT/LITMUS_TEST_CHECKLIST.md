# ✅ The Sophisticated Simplicity Litmus Test

**Before committing ANY code, run through this checklist.**

## The Six Tests

### 1️⃣ The Explainability Test
**Question**: Could I explain this code's purpose to a new team member in under 60 seconds?

```python
# ❌ FAILS the test
class ComplexSystemManagerFactoryBuilderStrategy:
    def initialize_multi_dimensional_context_aware_processor(self, config):
        # 500 lines of nested logic...

# ✅ PASSES the test  
class FrictionMonitor:
    """Tracks user confusion through simple behavioral signals."""
    def is_user_confused(self) -> bool:
        return self.error_rate > 0.3
```

### 2️⃣ The Composition Test
**Question**: Does this component do ONE thing well with a clean interface?

```python
# ❌ FAILS - God object doing everything
class SystemManager:
    def manage_packages(self): ...
    def monitor_health(self): ...
    def handle_errors(self): ...
    def update_ui(self): ...
    def send_notifications(self): ...

# ✅ PASSES - Single responsibility
class NotificationQueue:
    def add(self, message: str, priority: Priority): ...
    def flush(self): ...
```

### 3️⃣ The "Grandma Rose" Test
**Question**: Could I explain the benefit to Grandma Rose without jargon?

```
❌ FAILS: "This implements a Bayesian hierarchical model with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for probabilistic inference of user intent distributions."

✅ PASSES: "This watches for signs you're confused and offers more help when you need it."
```

### 4️⃣ The Deletion Test
**Question**: If I deleted this code, would the impact be clear and contained?

```python
# ❌ FAILS - Unclear dependencies everywhere
global_state_manager = GlobalStateManager()
# Used mysteriously throughout the codebase

# ✅ PASSES - Clear, isolated impact
def format_error_message(error: str) -> str:
    """Makes error messages friendly. Delete = raw errors."""
    return f"Oops! {error}. Try 'ask-nix help'"
```

### 5️⃣ The "Magic vs. Tutorial" Test
**Question**: Does the outcome feel like magic but the code read like a tutorial?

```python
# ❌ FAILS - Complex code, mediocre outcome
@decorator_factory(meta=True)
class AbstractMetaFactory(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    # 1000 lines to save one config file

# ✅ PASSES - Simple code, magical outcome
def batch_notifications(messages: List[str], interval: int = 120):
    """Hold non-critical messages for 2 minutes to protect flow."""
    # 20 lines that prevent 47% productivity loss
```

### 6️⃣ The Teachability Test 🆕
**Question**: Does this feature teach users something that makes the feature itself eventually unnecessary?

```
❌ FAILS: A complex wizard that users depend on forever without learning

✅ PASSES: Educational error messages that teach NixOS concepts, gradually making help unnecessary
✅ PASSES: Progressive disclosure that trains users from beginner → expert → no longer needing the UI
✅ PASSES: Friction monitoring that shows users their patterns, helping them self-correct
```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BEFORE COMMITTING, CAN YOU SAY YES?   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ □ Explainable in 60 seconds?           │
│ □ Does ONE thing well?                 │
│ □ Grandma Rose would understand?       │
│ □ Clear what happens if deleted?       │
│ □ Outcome magical, code simple?        │

## 📊 Examples from Our Codebase

### ✅ PASSES All Tests: Notification Queue
1. **Explainable**: "Batches messages to avoid interrupting you" (10 seconds)
2. **Composition**: Just queues and flushes notifications
3. **Grandma Rose**: "Like mail delivery - comes once, not constantly"
4. **Deletion**: System still works, just more interruptions
5. **Magic**: 100 lines prevent 47% productivity loss

### ✅ PASSES All Tests: Friction Monitor
1. **Explainable**: "Tracks if user is confused" (5 seconds)
2. **Composition**: Only monitors, doesn't act
3. **Grandma Rose**: "Notices when you need help"
4. **Deletion**: System less adaptive but functional
5. **Magic**: 150 lines accurately predict confusion

### ❌ WOULD FAIL: Complex Healing Engine V1
1. **Explainable**: Would take 10+ minutes to explain state machines
2. **Composition**: Did monitoring, healing, reporting, logging...
3. **Grandma Rose**: Too many technical concepts
4. **Deletion**: Unclear what would break
5. **Magic**: 5,768 lines for same outcome as 658

## 🎯 The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, choose the simpler solution.**

It's always easier to add complexity later than to remove it. Start embarrassingly simple. Let sophistication emerge through use, not design.

## 📝 Enforcement

This litmus test is:
- **Required** in all pull requests
- **Checked** during code review
- **Celebrated** when it leads to simplification

Remember: Every "No" is an opportunity to create something more elegant.

The simple code proves you CHOSE not to.  
That choice IS the sophistication."*
