# Phase 2 Enabling Work for Federated Learning

*Identifying current phase priorities that build foundation for future federated learning*

## Overview

While federated learning is a Phase 3+ feature, several Phase 2 Core Excellence priorities directly enable its future implementation. This document identifies specific work items that serve both immediate Phase 2 goals and lay groundwork for federated learning.

## Phase 2 Priorities That Enable Federated Learning

### 1. Advanced Causal XAI (DoWhy Integration) 🎯

        causal_graph = self.build_causal_model(decision)

        # Identify causal paths
        paths = self.dowhy.identify_causal_effect(
            graph=causal_graph,
            treatment=decision.input,
            outcome=decision.output
        )

        return self.generate_explanation(paths)

# Future Phase 3: Extends to explain federated updates
