# ðŸ¤– Local AI Integration Guide

## The Enhanced Sacred Trinity Model

**Original Trinity:**
- Human (Tristan) - Vision & Testing
- Claude - Architecture & Implementation  
- Local LLMs - Domain Expertise

**Enhanced with Local Models:**

### Your NixOS-Specialized Models

You have **custom-trained NixOS models** ready to use:

1. **nix-expert** (4.4 GB) - Deep NixOS knowledge
   - Configuration best practices
   - Flake architecture
   - Module system expertise

2. **nix-coder** (1.9 GB) - Code generation
   - Refactoring suggestions
   - Simple elegance patterns
   - Test generation

3. **nix-quick** (637 MB) - Fast responses
   - Quick validations
   - Syntax checks
   - Simple queries

4. **nix-empathy** (2.0 GB) - User experience
   - Error message improvements
   - Documentation writing
   - User feedback analysis

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Code Review Pipeline
```bash
# Before committing, get AI review
echo "Review for simple elegance" | ollama run nix-coder

# Check if feature aligns with philosophy
echo "Feature: $FEATURE_DESC" | ollama run nix-empathy
```

### 2. Simplification Assistant
```python
# In your development workflow
def simplify_with_ai(code: str) -> str:
    """Get AI suggestions for simplification."""
    prompt = f"Simplify this following THE LUMINOUS WAY:\n{code}"
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['ollama', 'run', 'nix-coder', prompt],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    return result.stdout
```

### 3. Deletion Ceremony Assistant
```bash
# AI helps identify what to delete
ollama run nix-expert "What files in src/ have duplicate functionality?"

# Validate deletions
ollama run nix-quick "Will deleting X break Y?"
```

## Cost Analysis

**Traditional Development:**
- Senior developers: $150-200/hour
- NixOS experts: $200-300/hour
- Team of 5: ~$4.2M/year

**Your Sacred Trinity + Local AI:**
- Claude Code: ~$100/month
- Local LLMs: FREE (already running)
- Electricity: ~$10/month
- **Total: ~$110/month**

**Value Multiplication: 3,200x**

## Practical Workflows

### Morning Ritual
```bash
# Start day with AI wisdom
echo "What should we simplify today?" | ollama run nix-expert

# Review yesterday's complexity
./scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py delete src/
```

### Before Each Commit
```bash
# The Litmus Test, AI-assisted
./scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py test "New feature description"

# Get simplification suggestions
git diff | ./scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py simplify
```

### During Development
```python
# Real-time assistance
import subprocess

def ask_nix_expert(question: str) -> str:
    """Quick NixOS expertise during coding."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['ollama', 'run', 'nix-expert:latest', question],
        capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=10
    )
    return result.stdout

# Usage
answer = ask_nix_expert("Best practice for systemd service?")
```

## Integration with Luminous Nix

### Adding AI to the CLI
```python
# In ask-nix command
if args.ai_assist:
    suggestion = ask_local_llm(user_query)
    print(f"AI suggests: {suggestion}")
```

### Smart Error Messages
```python
def enhance_error_with_ai(error: str) -> str:
    """Make errors educational with AI."""
    prompt = f"Explain this NixOS error simply: {error}"
    explanation = ollama_run('nix-empathy', prompt)
    return f"{error}\n\nðŸ’¡ {explanation}"
```

## Philosophy Alignment

Local AI serves THE LUMINOUS WAY by:
- **Suggesting simplifications** not additions
- **Finding complexity to delete** not features to add
- **Teaching through errors** not hiding them
- **Accelerating understanding** not replacing thinking

## Sacred Practices

### The AI Council
Before major decisions, consult all models:
```bash
QUESTION="Should we add feature X?"

echo "$QUESTION" | ollama run nix-expert   # Technical view
echo "$QUESTION" | ollama run nix-empathy  # User view
echo "$QUESTION" | ollama run nix-coder    # Implementation view
echo "$QUESTION" | ollama run nix-quick    # Quick gut check
```

### The Simplification Ceremony
Weekly ritual with AI assistance:
```bash
# Every Friday
./scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py delete src/ > deletion_candidates.md
# Review with human wisdom
# Perform deletion ceremony
```

## Getting Started

1. **Verify Ollama is running:**
   ```bash
   ollama list  # Shows your models
   ```

2. **Test each model:**
   ```bash
   echo "Hello" | ollama run nix-quick
   echo "Explain flakes" | ollama run nix-expert
   ```

3. **Integrate into workflow:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py
   ./scripts/ai_dev_assistant.py review src/luminous_nix/core/executor.py
   ```

## The Ultimate Goal

**AI doesn't replace human judgment, it amplifies human wisdom.**

Through AI assistance, we can:
- Delete 10x more complexity
- Achieve simple elegance faster
- Learn from every error
- Prove that $110/month > $4.2M/year

*"AI taught us that simple elegance was always more powerful than complexity. Now local AI helps us live that truth every day."*
