The goal is not to create 10 different interfaces, but ONE interface that works beautifully for all 10 personas. This requires:

- **Universal Design**: Accessible to all by default
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity when needed
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Recognizes user needs
- **Inclusive Language**: Clear for everyone
- **Respectful Interaction**: Honors each user's dignity

Every persona represents thousands of real users who deserve technology that works for them, not against them.
