# 🎊 Simplicity Rituals & Ceremonies

**Sacred practices to embed simplicity in our culture**

## 🗓️ The Rituals

### 1. The Deletion Ceremony (Monthly)

**When**: Last Friday of each month  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Purpose**: Celebrate code we removed

```python
# Run the ceremony
from luminous_nix.utils.complexity_budget import _budget_manager
print(_budget_manager.deletion_ceremony())
```

**Ceremony Format**:
1. Gather the team (even if it's just you)
2. Run the deletion ceremony script
3. Share the biggest simplification wins
4. Toast to the code that is no more! 🥂
5. Update the Wall of Deletion (see below)

### 2. The Simplicity Sprint (Quarterly)

**When**: First week of each quarter  
**Duration**: Full week  
**Purpose**: Dedicated time for ONLY simplification

**Rules**:
- ❌ NO new features allowed
- ❌ NO adding dependencies  
- ✅ ONLY deletion and simplification
- ✅ Refactoring for clarity
- ✅ Removing unused code

**Goals**:
- Reduce codebase by at least 10%
- Eliminate at least 2 dependencies
- Simplify at least 3 complex functions

**Tracking**:
```bash
# Start of sprint
git log --oneline -1 > sprint_start.txt
cloc . > loc_start.txt

# End of sprint
git diff --stat $(cat sprint_start.txt | cut -d' ' -f1)..HEAD
cloc . > loc_end.txt
diff loc_start.txt loc_end.txt
```

### 3. The Morning Litmus Test (Daily)

**When**: Before first commit of the day  
**Duration**: 2 minutes  
**Purpose**: Set intention for simplicity

**Practice**:
1. Read the 6 Litmus Test questions aloud
2. Set intention: "Today I will add value by subtracting complexity"
3. First task: Can anything be deleted before adding?

### 4. The Complexity Check-in (Weekly)

**When**: End of week  
**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Purpose**: Review complexity budget

```python
from luminous_nix.utils.complexity_budget import _budget_manager
print(_budget_manager.report())

# If over 80% of budget:
print("⚠️ Time to simplify before adding!")
```

## 📊 The Wall of Deletion

Create a file: `WALL_OF_DELETION.md`

Celebrating the code we had the courage to delete!

## 🎯 Simplicity Challenges

### The 100-Line Challenge
Can you implement a useful feature in under 100 lines?
- Post your achievement
- Explain what it does
- Share the magic/tutorial ratio

### The Dependency Diet
Remove one dependency per month
- Document what it did
- Show how you replaced it (or didn't need it)
- Calculate complexity budget saved

### The One-Day Wonder
What's the most useful thing you can ship in ONE day?
- Must pass all 6 Litmus Tests
- Must be embarrassingly simple
- Must provide real user value

## 🌟 Simplicity Mantras

Start each ritual with one of these:

1. **"The best code is no code"**
2. **"Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away"**
3. **"Think deeply, build simply, let sophistication emerge"**
4. **"Every line of code is a liability"**
5. **"Deletion is creation"**
6. **"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"**

## 📈 Tracking Success

### Metrics That Matter
- **Lines of Code**: ↓ is success
- **Dependencies**: ↓ is success  
- **Friction Score**: ↓ is success
- **Time to Understanding**: ↓ is success
- **User Delight**: ↑ is success

### Anti-Metrics (Ignore These)
- ❌ Features shipped
- ❌ Story points completed
- ❌ Code coverage (quality > quantity)
- ❌ Commits per day

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Today**: Do the Morning Litmus Test
2. **This Week**: Run Complexity Check-in
3. **This Month**: Hold your first Deletion Ceremony
4. **This Quarter**: Plan your first Simplicity Sprint

## 💭 Remember

These rituals aren't overhead - they're how we maintain velocity. By constantly simplifying, we move faster, not slower. 

**Complex systems slow down over time.**
**Simple systems accelerate.**

But with these rituals, it becomes a practice, then a habit, then a way of being.
