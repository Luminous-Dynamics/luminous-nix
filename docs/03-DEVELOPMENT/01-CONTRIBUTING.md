- `bug` - Something's broken

### ‚ú® Features
Before implementing new features:
1. Check if it exists in `implementations/`
2. Discuss in an issue first
3. Follow our [Code Standards](./04-CODE-STANDARDS.md)

## Development Workflow

### The Sacred Pause
Before coding, take 30 seconds to:
1. **PAUSE** - Center your awareness
2. **REFLECT** - How does this serve users?
3. **CONNECT** - How does this build trust?
4. **FOCUS** - What's the ONE next step?

### Code Standards Summary
- **Language**: TypeScript (not JavaScript)
- **Testing**: Behavior at boundaries, implementation at core
- **Style**: Functional by default, classes for state
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - check before adding
- **Personas**: Design for all 10 personas

Full details: [Code Standards](./04-CODE-STANDARDS.md)

### Testing Requirements
- **Minimum**: 80% overall coverage
- **Critical paths**: 95% (NLP, execution, safety)
- **All PRs**: Must include tests
- **Personas**: Test with persona scenarios

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commits:
```
feat: add voice input support
fix: correct typo detection in nlp engine
docs: update troubleshooting guide
test: add unit tests for command executor
refactor: simplify learning system architecture
```

## Submission Guidelines

### Before Submitting PR

1. **Run all tests**
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh test-cov
   # Coverage should not decrease!
   ```

2. **Check code quality**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format
   ```

3. **Update documentation**
   - Add/update relevant docs
   - Include inline comments for complex logic
   - Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

4. **Test with personas**
   - Would Grandma Rose understand your error messages?
   - Is it fast enough for Maya (ADHD)?
   - Can Alex (blind) navigate it?

## Advanced Contributing

### Adding New NLP Patterns
```python
# Add to packages/patterns/index.ts
export const PATTERNS = {
  your_intent: {
    patterns: [
      /^your pattern$/i,
      /^alternative pattern$/i,
    ],
    examples: [
      'example usage',
      'another example'
    ]
  }
};
```

### Creating New Personas Tests
```python
# tests/e2e/test_persona_journeys.py
@pytest.mark.parametrize("persona", ALL_PERSONAS)
def test_your_feature(persona):
    """Test your feature works for all personas."""
    simulator = PersonaSimulator(persona)
    # Test persona-specific interaction
```

### Performance Optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Respect budgets (< 2s response time)
- Test with minimal hardware
- Consider all personas' needs
