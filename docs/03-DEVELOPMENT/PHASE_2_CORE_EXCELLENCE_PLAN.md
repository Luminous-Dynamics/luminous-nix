## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Performance Architecture
```yaml
Caching Strategy:
  - In-memory LRU cache for NLP results
  - Persistent cache for XAI explanations
  - Precomputed common operations
  - Smart cache invalidation

Optimization Targets:
  - NLP: <50ms (from 100ms)
  - XAI: <100ms (from 200ms)
  - TUI: <10ms (from 20ms)
  - Total: <200ms end-to-end
```

### Security Architecture
```yaml
Validation Layers:
  1. Input sanitization
  2. Command validation
  3. Permission checking
  4. Output filtering

Security Features:
  - Rate limiting
  - Audit logging
  - Fail-safe defaults
  - Principle of least privilege
```

### Causal XAI Design
```python
class CausalExplainer:
    """Generate causal explanations using DoWhy"""

    def explain_causally(self, intent, context):
        # Build causal graph
        graph = self.build_causal_model(intent, context)

        # Identify causal paths
        paths = self.find_causal_paths(graph)

        # Generate explanation
        explanation = self.generate_because_chain(paths)

        # Add counterfactuals
        alternatives = self.what_if_analysis(graph)

        return CausalExplanation(
            explanation=explanation,
            confidence=self.calibrated_confidence,
            alternatives=alternatives
        )
```

## 🗓️ Daily Flow (Kairos Time)

### When Performance Work Ripens
1. Morning benchmark runs
2. Optimization implementation
3. Testing and validation
4. Performance monitoring

### When Security Work Calls

2. Implementation
3. Security testing
4. Audit review

### When XAI Work Emerges
1. Causal model design
2. Implementation
3. Explanation testing
4. User validation

## 🌊 Sacred Development Practices

### The Daily Pause
Before each work session:
1. **Center**: What serves users today?
2. **Focus**: What's the ONE thing?
3. **Intent**: How does this build trust?
4. **Flow**: Let the work guide itself

### Quality Checkpoints
- Every function improves user experience
- Every optimization maintains clarity
- Every security measure respects users
- Every explanation builds understanding

## 🚦 Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Over-optimization**: Losing clarity for speed
2. **Security Theater**: Adding friction without benefit
3. **XAI Complexity**: Explanations becoming confusing
4. **Testing Fatigue**: Users overwhelmed by process

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Balance**: Speed with understanding
2. **Invisible Security**: Protection without friction
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple first, details optional
4. **Respectful Testing**: Value user time
