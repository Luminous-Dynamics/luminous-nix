# v1.1 Planning - TUI & Voice Release

## Target: 2-4 weeks after v1.0 feedback

### Primary Goals
1. **Enable the TUI** - It's already built, just needs connection
2. **Voice Interface** - Architecture is complete
3. **Bug Fixes** - Based on v1.0 user feedback

### Already Implemented (Just Needs Activation)
- ✅ Beautiful Textual TUI with panels
- ✅ Voice interface architecture
- ✅ Learning system framework
- ✅ Error intelligence enhancements

### Minimal New Development Needed
```python
# Literally just need to connect:
# 1. TUI → Backend (1 day)
# 2. Voice → Backend (1 day)
# 3. Testing & Polish (3 days)
```

### User-Requested Features (Track from v1.0)
