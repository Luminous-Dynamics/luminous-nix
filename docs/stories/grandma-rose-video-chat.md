# ðŸ‘µ User Story: Grandma Rose Wants to Video Chat

**Persona**: Grandma Rose (75)
**Goal**: Video chat with grandchildren
**Technical Level**: Beginner
**Preferred Input**: Voice

## The Story

Rose's daughter just texted: "Mom, the kids want to video chat with you!"

Rose walks to her computer, a bit nervous. She's heard about Skype and Zoom but isn't sure which to use or how to install them.

## The Conversation

**Rose** (speaking to computer): "I need to video chat with my grandkids"

**Nix for Humanity**: "I'd be happy to help you video chat with your grandkids! There are a few good options. Zoom is very popular and what many families use. Would you like me to set up Zoom for you?"

**Rose**: "Is that the one everyone uses? Yes, that sounds good"

**Nix for Humanity**: "Perfect! I'll install Zoom for you. This will take about 2 minutes. Once it's ready, you'll see a new icon on your desktop called 'Zoom'."

*[Installation happens in background with progress indicator]*

**Nix for Humanity**: "Great news! Zoom is ready. Would you like me to help you start your first video call?"

**Rose**: "Yes please! My daughter sent me something about a meeting ID?"

**Nix for Humanity**: "That's exactly what you need! When you open Zoom, look for a button that says 'Join Meeting' and click it. Then you can type in that meeting ID your daughter sent. Shall I open Zoom for you now?"

**Rose**: "Yes, open it"

*[Zoom opens]*

**Nix for Humanity**: "Zoom is open! Click the blue 'Join Meeting' button, then type the meeting ID your daughter sent you. Make sure your camera and microphone are on - you'll see little icons at the bottom of the screen."

**Rose**: "Oh, I see it! Thank you so much!"
