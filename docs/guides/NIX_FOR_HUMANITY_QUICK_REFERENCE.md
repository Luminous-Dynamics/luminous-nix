# 🚀 Nix for Humanity - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Core Concept
**NOT a traditional GUI** - This is a natural language interface to NixOS that lets users speak/type in plain English.

## 💬 Example Interactions
```
"Install Firefox" → Installs Firefox
"My wifi isn't working" → Runs diagnostics and fixes
"I need to edit documents" → Suggests and installs office apps
"Make my system faster" → Optimizes settings safely
```

## 👥 The 5 Sacred Personas
1. **Grandma Rose (75)** - Voice-first, zero tech terms
2. **Maya (16)** - Speed focus, progressive complexity
3. **David (42)** - Business reliability, professional
4. **Dr. Sarah (35)** - Research reproducibility, technical
5. **Alex (28)** - Blind developer, 100% accessible

## 🏗️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (NOT vanilla JS!)
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript + WebSockets
- **Intent Engine**: JavaScript pattern matching
- **Nix Core**: Rust AST builder
- **System Helper**: C with Polkit
- **Voice**: Web Speech API → Whisper (future)

## 🔐 Security
- JWT auth (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- Polkit for system operations
- Group permissions: nixos-gui-basic/user/admin
- Full audit logging with intent tracking

## 🌊 Three Stages of User Journey
1. **Sanctuary (0-30 days)**: Everything just works, total protection
2. **Growth (30-365 days)**: System adapts, shortcuts appear
3. **Mastery (365+ days)**: Near-zero interaction, perfect timing

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Intent accuracy: >95%
- Response time: <1s
- First success: <2 minutes
- User satisfaction: >90%
- Accessibility: 100% WCAG

## 🚀 Current Status
- Phase 1 (Foundation) mostly complete
- Natural language basics working
- Security architecture done
- Voice prototype functional
- Ready for Phase 2 (Enhancement)

## 🔮 Phase 2 Enhancements (Approved)
1. **Intent Confidence Display** - Show uncertainty transparently
2. **Graceful Failure Handling** - "I didn't understand, can you rephrase?"
3. **Progressive Trust** - Earn right to act without confirmation
4. **Frustration Detection** - Recognize and respond to user struggle
5. **Learning Mode** - System asks what unknown phrases mean

## 💡 Key Differentiators
1. **Natural Language First** - No commands to learn
2. **Voice Native** - Not voice-added
3. **Accessibility Perfect** - From day one
4. **Local First** - No cloud dependency
5. **Learning System** - Adapts to each user
6. **Sacred License** - SRL prevents exploitation

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **No notifications** by default
- **Single focus** interface
- **Natural pauses** built in
- **Progressive disclosure** of complexity
- **Invisible excellence** - disappears when mastered

## 🔌 API Patterns
```
POST /api/intent/process     - Process natural language
GET  /api/packages/search    - Find packages
POST /api/system/rebuild     - Apply changes
WS   /api/realtime          - Live updates
```

## 📝 Remember
This is "Nix for Humanity" - making NixOS accessible to EVERYONE through natural conversation. It's not just a GUI with buttons - it's a complete reimagining of human-computer interaction for system management.
