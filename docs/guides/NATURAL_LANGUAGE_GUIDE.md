# üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Guide - Nix for Humanity

## Welcome! Speak or Type Naturally

With Nix for Humanity, you don't need to learn computer commands. Just use your own words to tell NixOS what you want.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Choose Your Input Method

#### üí¨ Typing
Just type what you want in plain language:
```
You: install firefox
You: my internet isn't working
You: update everything
You: show me what's installed
```

#### üé§ Speaking
Click the microphone or say "Hey Nix":
```
You: "install firefox"
You: "my internet isn't working"
You: "update everything"
You: "show me what's installed"
```

**Both methods work exactly the same!** Choose what's comfortable for you.

## üìù Common Tasks

### Installing Software

Say it however feels natural:
- "install firefox"
- "get me firefox"
- "i need firefox"
- "i want to browse the web" (suggests browsers)
- "install something for email" (suggests email clients)

### Removing Software

Express it your way:
- "remove firefox"
- "uninstall firefox"
- "get rid of firefox"
- "i don't need firefox anymore"
- "delete that browser"

### Updating Your System

Many ways to say it:
- "update"
- "update system"
- "update everything"
- "check for updates"
- "make everything current"

### Getting Help

Just ask:
- "help"
- "what can you do?"
- "how do i..."
- "show me how to..."
- "i'm stuck"

### Troubleshooting

Describe the problem naturally:
- "my wifi isn't working"
- "no internet"
- "can't print"
- "screen is too bright"
- "computer is slow"

## üéØ Understanding How It Works

### Natural Variations

The system understands many ways to say the same thing:

| What You Want | Ways You Can Say It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Install VS Code | "install vscode", "get me vs code", "i need to write code", "install that microsoft editor" |
| System Info | "show system info", "what version am i running", "system details", "about my computer" |
| Disk Space | "disk space", "how much room", "storage left", "am i running out of space" |

### Context Awareness

After searching for something, you can refer to it:
```
You: search for text editors
Nix: Found: vim, emacs, vscode, sublime
You: install the third one
Nix: Installing vscode...
```

### Clarification

When there are multiple options:
```
You: install office
Nix: Do you mean LibreOffice (free) or OnlyOffice?
You: the free one
Nix: Installing LibreOffice...
```

## üåü Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific When Needed
- "install firefox" - Clear and specific
