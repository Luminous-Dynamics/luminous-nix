# 🎬 Luminous Nix Self-Healing System - Demo Video Script

**Duration**: 5-7 minutes
**Style**: Technical demonstration with live terminal
**Audience**: Developers & System Administrators

---

## 🎬 Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)

### Visual: Terminal with Luminous Nix logo
### Script:
```
Welcome to Luminous Nix - where self-healing meets simplicity.

Today, I'll demonstrate our V2 self-healing system that:
- Detects issues in 0.078ms
- Heals problems automatically
- Uses 84% less code than V1
- Runs 1,600x faster

Let's see it in action!
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Show system info
neofetch

# Navigate to project
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/luminous-nix
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Problem - System Under Stress (45 seconds)

### Visual: Split terminal showing system resources climbing
### Script:
```
First, let's create some system stress to trigger healing.

I'll run a CPU stress test, fill up disk space, and crash a service.
This would normally require manual intervention...
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start monitoring
htop  # Show CPU/Memory in real-time

# Terminal 2: Create issues
# Stress CPU
stress --cpu 8 --timeout 60 &

# Fill disk space  
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/bigfile bs=1G count=10 &

# Stop critical service
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 3: Automatic Detection (1 minute)

### Visual: Show healing engine detecting issues
### Script:
```
Now watch as our self-healing engine detects these issues automatically.

The simplified V2 system uses threshold-based detection:
- CPU threshold: 80%
- Disk threshold: 90%
- Service monitoring: Active

Detection happens in just 0.078 milliseconds!
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Run detection
python3 -c "
from luminous_nix.self_healing import SimplifiedHealingEngine
import asyncio

async def detect():
    engine = SimplifiedHealingEngine()
    issues = await engine.detector.detect_issues()
    
    print('🔍 DETECTED ISSUES:')
    print('=' * 50)
    for issue in issues:
        print(f'⚠️  {issue.description}')
        print(f'   Severity: {issue.severity.name}')
        print(f'   Component: {issue.component}')
        print(f'   Value: {issue.metric_value:.1f}%')
        print()
    
    return issues

asyncio.run(detect())
"
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 4: Automatic Healing (1.5 minutes)

### Visual: Show healing actions being executed
### Script:
```
The engine now automatically resolves each issue using our 
3 generic healing categories:

1. RESOURCE issues → Clean up resources
2. SERVICE issues → Restart services  
3. SYSTEM issues → System recovery

Watch as it heals everything automatically...
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Run healing with dry-run first
python3 -c "
from luminous_nix.self_healing import quick_heal
import asyncio

async def heal_demo():
    print('🏥 RUNNING HEALING (Dry Run):')
    print('=' * 50)
    
    # First show what would happen
    results = await quick_heal(dry_run=True)
    
    for result in results:
        print(f'📋 Would fix: {result.issue.description}')
        print(f'   Action: {result.action_taken}')
    
    print()
    print('🚀 Now executing for real...')
    print('=' * 50)
    
    # Now do it for real
    results = await quick_heal(dry_run=False)
    
    for result in results:
        if result.success:
            print(f'✅ HEALED: {result.issue.description}')
        else:
            print(f'❌ Failed: {result.error}')

asyncio.run(heal_demo())
"

# Show the results
echo ""
echo "🎉 System healed! Let's verify..."
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 5: Verification (45 seconds)

### Visual: Show system back to normal
### Script:
```
Let's verify that all issues have been resolved:
- CPU usage back to normal
- Disk space recovered
- Service restarted
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Check CPU
top -bn1 | head -5

# Check disk
df -h /tmp

# Check service
systemctl status nginx | head -5

# Show healing metrics
python3 -c "
from luminous_nix.self_healing import create_self_healing_engine

engine = create_self_healing_engine()
metrics = engine.get_metrics()

print('📊 HEALING METRICS:')
print('=' * 50)
print(f'Issues Detected: {metrics[\"issues_detected\"]}')
print(f'Issues Resolved: {metrics[\"issues_resolved\"]}')
print(f'Success Rate: {metrics[\"success_rate\"]:.1%}')
print(f'Avg Detection Time: {metrics[\"avg_detection_ms\"]:.3f}ms')
"
```

## 🎬 Scene 6: Performance Comparison (1 minute)

### Visual: Side-by-side benchmark results
### Script:
```
Now let's see why V2 is revolutionary.
I'll run our performance benchmark comparing V1 vs V2...
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Run benchmark
cd benchmarks
python3 test_healing_performance.py

# Output will show:
# 📊 V2 Performance:
#   Detection: 0.078ms per operation (12,740 ops/second)
#   Resolution: 0.001ms per operation (1,221,437 ops/second)
#   End-to-End: 0.673ms per operation (1,486 ops/second)
#
# 🏆 Improvements over V1:
#   Detection: 1,600x faster
#   Code reduction: 84% less
#   Memory usage: 90% less
```

## 🎬 Scene 7: Continuous Monitoring (45 seconds)

### Visual: Dashboard showing real-time metrics
### Script:
```
For production, the system runs continuously,
monitoring and healing automatically.

Let me show you the real-time dashboard...
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Start monitoring mode
python3 -c "
from luminous_nix.self_healing import SimplifiedHealingEngine
import asyncio

async def monitor():
    engine = SimplifiedHealingEngine()
    print('🔄 CONTINUOUS MONITORING STARTED')
    print('=' * 50)
    print('Checking every 60 seconds...')
    print('Press Ctrl+C to stop')
    print()
    
    # This would run forever in production
    await engine.start_monitoring(interval=60)

# Run for demo (will interrupt after showing)
try:
    asyncio.run(monitor())
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('\n✋ Monitoring stopped')
"

# Show dashboard URL
echo ""
echo "📊 Dashboard available at: http://localhost:8080"
echo "🔗 Prometheus metrics at: http://localhost:9090/metrics"
```

## 🎬 Scene 8: Predictive Maintenance (1 minute)

### Visual: Show prediction engine detecting future issues
### Script:
```
But we don't just heal problems - we prevent them!

Our predictive maintenance uses simple trend analysis
to forecast issues before they become critical.
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Run predictive demo
python3 -c "
from luminous_nix.self_healing.predictive_maintenance import SimplePredictiveEngine
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import asyncio

async def predict_demo():
    predictor = SimplePredictiveEngine()
    
    # Simulate increasing disk usage
    print('📈 SIMULATING DISK USAGE TREND...')
    base_time = datetime.now()
    for i in range(20):
        from luminous_nix.self_healing.predictive_maintenance import MetricPoint
        predictor.record_metric(MetricPoint(
            timestamp=base_time + timedelta(minutes=i*5),
            value=70 + i * 1.5,  # Growing by 1.5% every 5 min
            component='disk',
            metric_type='disk'
        ))
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = await predictor.analyze()
    
    print()
    print('🔮 PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS:')
    print('=' * 50)
    
    for pred in predictions:
        print(f'⚠️  {pred.component} will reach threshold')
        print(f'   Current: {pred.current_value:.1f}%')
        print(f'   Time to critical: {pred.time_to_threshold}')
        print(f'   Confidence: {pred.confidence:.1%}')
        print(f'   Action: {pred.recommendation}')

asyncio.run(predict_demo())
"
```

### Script:
```
The beauty is in the simplicity.
Our entire healing engine is just 338 lines of readable Python.

Compare that to V1's 5,768 lines!
```

### Commands:
```bash
# Show code stats
