# 🎯 Nix for Humanity - Focused Development Context

*From sprawling vision to laser-focused execution: Two hero capabilities in 6 weeks*

## 🚨 CRITICAL: FOCUS DISCIPLINE 🚨
**See**: [FOCUSED_ROADMAP.md](FOCUSED_ROADMAP.md) for the 6-week plan  
**See**: [CLEANUP_PLAN.md](CLEANUP_PLAN.md) for what we're removing  
**Remember**: Two features done perfectly > Twenty done poorly

## 🎯 v1.0 Focus: Two Hero Capabilities

### 1. Lightning-Fast Native Operations ⚡
**What**: Complete Python-Nix API integration  
**Why**: Eliminates #1 pain point (subprocess timeouts)  
**Goal**: All operations <0.5 seconds  
**Status**: Partially working, needs completion

### 2. Smart Learning Loop 🧠
**What**: Learn from user patterns and improve  
**Why**: Makes the assistant genuinely helpful  
**Goal**: Visibly smarter after 10 uses  
**Status**: Components exist, not connected

## 📊 Current Reality (Honest Assessment)

**Actually Working**:
- ✅ Basic CLI (`ask-nix "help"`)
- ✅ Intent recognition (~70% accuracy)
- ✅ Package search (mostly works)
- ✅ Security layer (no injection)

**Not Reliable**:
- ⚠️ Install/update commands (fail often)
- ⚠️ Native API (partial integration)
- ⚠️ Error handling (confusing messages)

**Not Working**:
- ❌ Learning system (saves data, doesn't use it)
- ❌ TUI connection (exists but separate)
- ❌ Voice interface (defer to v1.1)
- ❌ 10 personas (using 3 styles only)

## 🗓️ 6-Week Sprint Plan

### Week 1 (Jan 13-19): Brutal Cleanup
- Delete voice interface code
- Archive research docs (don't implement)
- Remove Theory of Mind components
- Consolidate from 10 personas to 3
- Simplify directory structure
- Rewrite README to reflect reality

### Week 2-3 (Jan 20 - Feb 2): Native API Excellence
- Complete nixos_rebuild integration
- Add real progress indicators
- Handle all edge cases
- Optimize for <0.5s operations
- Write integration tests (real, not mocks)

### Week 4-5 (Feb 3-16): Learning Loop
- Track command success/failure
- Build pattern recognition
- Implement suggestion engine
- Show learning progress to user
- Test with real usage patterns

### Week 6 (Feb 17-23): Polish & Ship
- Fix critical bugs
- Performance optimization
- Update documentation (4 files only)
- Create demo video
- Release v1.0!

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing

### Explicitly Deferred
- ❌ Voice interfaces → v1.1
- ❌ Complex TUI → v1.1
- ❌ 10 personas → 3 styles only
- ❌ Federated learning → v2.0
- ❌ Theory of Mind → Future
- ❌ Consciousness fields → Future
- ❌ Sacred computing UI → Future

### Stop Doing
- Writing aspirational documentation
- Creating placeholder features
- Implementing research papers
- Building distributed systems
- Over-engineering simple problems

## 📝 Development Rules for v1.0

### Code Discipline
1. **No new features** until hero capabilities work
2. **Delete more than you add** this week
3. **Simple > Complex** every time
4. **Working > Perfect** ship iteratively
5. **Test real commands** not mocks

### Documentation Discipline
1. **4 files only**: README, QUICKSTART, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING
2. **Document what exists**, not what might be
3. **Examples that work**, not aspirational ones
4. **Clear about limitations**, honest about status

### Focus Discipline
1. **Two features only** for v1.0
2. **Say no** to everything else
3. **Measure progress** on hero capabilities
4. **Delete distractions** ruthlessly
5. **Ship on time** even if imperfect

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] 80% less code/docs
- [ ] Clean directory structure
- [ ] Honest README
- [ ] Clear focus

### v1.0 Success
- [ ] Native API: <0.5s for all operations
- [ ] Learning: Improves after 10 uses
- [ ] Reliability: 95% command success
- [ ] Simplicity: New user productive in 10min
- [ ] Shipped: February 23, 2025

## 💡 Daily Reminders

**Every Morning Ask**:
1. What moves the two hero capabilities forward?
2. What can I delete/simplify today?
3. Am I documenting reality or fantasy?

**Every Evening Check**:
1. Did I resist feature creep?
2. Did I test with real commands?
3. Is the code simpler than yesterday?

## 🚀 The North Star

**In 6 weeks, users will say**:
> "Wow, Nix operations are actually fast now!"  
> "It's learning what I need and helping me!"  
> "This is simple enough that I trust it."

**NOT**:
> "It has so many features but none work well."  
> "The documentation promises things that don't exist."  
> "It's too complex to understand."

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Hero Capability 1: Native API
```python
# Current (slow, timeouts)
subprocess.run(["nix-env", "-iA", "firefox"])  # 5+ seconds

# v1.0 (fast, reliable)
nix.install("firefox")  # <0.5 seconds
```

### Hero Capability 2: Learning
```bash
# First use
> ask-nix "install neovim"
Installing neovim...

# After 10 uses
> ask-nix "install neovim"
Installing neovim... 
💡 You often install dev tools. Try 'ask-nix dev-setup' for common packages.
```

## 🏁 Definition of Done

**v1.0 ships when**:
1. Native API handles all common operations <0.5s
2. Learning loop demonstrably improves suggestions
3. 95% reliability on top 20 commands
4. Documentation matches reality exactly
5. New users are productive in 10 minutes
