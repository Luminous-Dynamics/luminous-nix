# Nix for Humanity v1.0 - Production Ready

> *Simple. Reliable. Human-Friendly NixOS.*

## What is v1.0?

Nix for Humanity v1.0 is a streamlined, production-ready natural language interface for NixOS. We've focused on making the essential commands work perfectly rather than trying to do everything.

## ✅ What Works in v1.0

### Core Features
- **Natural Language Understanding** - "install firefox" just works
- **Native Python-Nix API** - 10x faster than subprocess calls
- **Two Personas** - Beginner-friendly or Expert mode
- **Essential Commands** - Install, remove, update, search, rollback
- **Smart Error Messages** - Helpful guidance when things go wrong
- **Progress Indicators** - Know what's happening
- **Basic Learning** - Remembers your preferences
- **Security First** - Safe by default

### Supported Commands
```bash
# Installation
ask-nix "install firefox"
ask-nix "install git and neovim"

# Search
ask-nix "search for text editors"
ask-nix "what packages provide python"

# Updates
ask-nix "update my system"
ask-nix "update firefox"

# Management
ask-nix "list installed packages"
ask-nix "remove unused packages"
ask-nix "rollback to previous generation"

# Help
ask-nix "help"
ask-nix "how do I install from unstable"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity
cd nix-for-humanity

# Enter development environment
nix develop

# Run v1.0
./nix_humanity_v1.py "install firefox"
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start interactive session
./nix_humanity_v1.py

# Or with expert persona
./nix_humanity_v1.py --persona expert
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy for v1.0

### Do One Thing Well
Instead of 50 features at 70% quality, we have 10 features at 100% quality.

### Every Command Works
If a command is supported, it works reliably every time.

### Clear Communication
Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Fast Response
Native Python-Nix API means instant responses, not 5-second waits.

### Safe by Default
Preview changes before applying them. No surprises.
