## My Top 5 Recommendations

Based on user impact and alignment with our mission:

### 1. **Home Manager Integration** 🥇
- Highly requested by users
- Natural extension of config generation
- Personal touch makes NixOS feel like home

### 2. **NixOS Error Translation** 🥈
- Biggest pain point for new users
- Directly serves our accessibility mission
- High impact on user confidence

### 3. **Smart Package Discovery** 🥉
- Solves "what's the package called?" problem
- Makes exploration delightful
- Reduces friction significantly

### 4. **Service Management** 
- Common use case for servers
- Security by default is crucial
- Templates make it accessible

### 5. **Network Configuration**
- Universal pain point
- Especially important for new users
- WiFi should "just work"

## Integration Opportunities

These features could beautifully integrate with what we've built:

- **Error Translation** + Generation Management = "This error happened after generation 42"
- **Home Manager** + Config Generation = Complete system and user setup
- **Package Discovery** + Flakes = "Add these packages to my dev environment"
- **Service Management** + Config Generation = Full server configurations

## The Meta Feature: Learning & Adaptation

One overarching feature could tie everything together:

### 🧠 Intelligent Learning System
- Learn from user patterns
- Predict needs before they're expressed
- Share anonymized wisdom across users
- Gradually reduce the need for explicit commands

"The best interface is no interface" - the system that knows what you need.
