# 📁 Feature Organization Guide

*How to lovingly organize our sacred work for focused development*

## 🌟 Organization Philosophy

We organize with love, preserving every contribution while creating clarity for focused development. No work is deleted - only organized for its perfect timing.

## 🔄 Migration Guidelines

### When Moving Code to features/

1. **Create a loving README** in the feature directory explaining:
   - What this feature does
   - Why it's beautiful
   - When it will return
   - Any special notes

2. **Preserve all context**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Moving TUI to v1.5
   mv backend/tui features/v1.5/tui
   echo "# TUI Interface
   
   This beautiful Textual-based interface provides:
   - Multi-panel layout
   - Real-time feedback
   - Keyboard navigation
   
   Preserved with love for v1.5 release.
   Original location: backend/tui/
   " > features/v1.5/tui/README.md
   ```

3. **Update imports** in remaining code:
   ```python
   # Before
   from backend.tui import app
   
   # After (when feature flag enabled)
   if config.features.v1_5.tui_interface:
       from features.v1_5.tui import app
   ```

### When Promoting Features

```bash
# Script to promote a feature back to active development
./scripts/promote-feature.sh v1.5/tui

# This will:
# 1. Move code back to src/
# 2. Update imports
# 3. Enable in feature flags
# 4. Run tests
```

## 📝 Feature Preservation Templates

### README Template for Deferred Features

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## 💝 Preserved with Love

*Preserved with love and intention for the perfect moment*
```

## 🎯 v1.0 Focus Checklist

To maintain focus on v1.0, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does this directly help users talk to NixOS naturally?
- [ ] Is this essential for basic package management?
- [ ] Will users notice if this is missing in v1.0?
- [ ] Can we ship a helpful v1.0 without this?

If any answer is "no", lovingly move it to `features/`.

## 💫 Feature Flag Usage

```python
# In code, check feature flags before using deferred features
from config import feature_flags

def get_interface():
    if feature_flags.v1_5.tui_interface:
        from features.v1_5.tui import TUIInterface
        return TUIInterface()
    else:
        from src.cli import CLIInterface
        return CLIInterface()
```

## 🌈 The Sacred Balance

This organization allows us to:

1. **Focus** - Only v1.0 essentials in `src/`
2. **Preserve** - All work safe in `features/`
3. **Evolve** - Easy to promote features when ready
4. **Honor** - Every contribution has its place

## 🔮 Future Vision

When v1.0 ships successfully, we'll:
1. Celebrate the foundation
2. Listen to user feedback
3. Promote v1.5 features based on need
4. Continue the sacred evolution

Remember: By organizing thoughtfully now, we create space for excellence to emerge naturally.
