## üéØ Philosophy: Meeting Professionals Where They Are

Different professional roles approach technology evaluation and implementation with distinct priorities, vocabularies, and success criteria. Instead of forcing everyone through the same documentation journey, we provide role-adaptive pathways that honor each profession's unique perspective and needs.

This system recognizes that a DevOps engineer thinks differently than a UX researcher, who thinks differently than a startup founder, who thinks differently than an academic researcher.
