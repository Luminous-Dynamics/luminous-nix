**Next Read**: [Backend Architecture](./02-BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE.md)
```

### Enhancement 3: Progressive Onboarding Flows
**Current**: Quick start exists but could be more granular
**Enhancement**: Create multiple commitment-level entry points

**Proposed Onboarding Tracks**:
```markdown
### ⚡ 2-Minute Overview
**Goal**: Understand core value proposition
**Path**: README → Quick Features → One Example

### 🔍 15-Minute Deep Dive  
**Goal**: Grasp architecture and key decisions
**Path**: Unified Vision → System Architecture → Sacred Trinity

### 🧭 1-Hour Comprehensive
**Goal**: Full technical understanding
**Path**: Complete Vision → Architecture Suite → Development Standards

### 🌊 Multi-Session Mastery
**Goal**: Research integration and implementation
**Path**: Research Navigation → Implementation Guides → Testing Excellence
```

### Enhancement 4: Implementation Bridge Matrix
**Current**: Good research-to-code mapping but could be tighter
**Enhancement**: Comprehensive cross-reference between research insights and code locations

**Example Matrix Structure**:
```markdown
| Research Insight | Architecture Decision | Code Module | Test Coverage |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Vulnerability as Trust | Constitutional AI | backend/ai/constitutional.py | 95% |
| Flow State Protection | Interruption Calculus | tui/flow_monitor.py | 87% |
| Persona of One | Dynamic User Modeling | backend/user/persona_engine.py | 92% |
```

### Enhancement 5: Contextual Navigation Hints
**Current**: Strong cross-referencing but could be more dynamic
**Enhancement**: "Where to go next" suggestions based on current document context

**Example Implementation**:
```markdown
