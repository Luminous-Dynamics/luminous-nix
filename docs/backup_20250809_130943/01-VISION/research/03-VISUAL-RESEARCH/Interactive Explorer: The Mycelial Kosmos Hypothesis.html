    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthen Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a non-linear, exploratory hub. It opens with an introduction to the core hypothesis. The main interactive element is a radar chart visualizing the "Matrix of Resonances," allowing users to dynamically compare the hypothesis's strength across different domains (Physics, Biology, etc.). Clicking a navigation button filters the chart and reveals a dedicated section below with detailed, collapsible "Resonance Cards" for each concept within that domain. This structure transforms passive reading into active exploration, visually reinforcing the report's theme of interconnectedness and allowing users to follow their own curiosity rather than a rigid, linear path. The final section synthesizes the ethical implications. This design was chosen to make a dense, philosophical text engaging, digestible, and intellectually playful. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Matrix of Resonances -> Goal: Compare & Organize -> Viz/Method: Interactive Radar Chart -> Interaction: Filter buttons update the chart data. Clicking a point (future feature) would show details. -> Justification: A radar chart visually compares multiple variables, perfectly showing the "shape" of resonance for each domain. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Detailed explanations of each resonance (e.g., Entanglement, Anima Mundi) -> Goal: Inform & Explore -> Viz/Method: Collapsible Accordion Cards -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse content. -> Justification: Prevents overwhelming users with text. Promotes focused reading and a sense of discovery. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Core concepts and ethical principles -> Goal: Inform & Synthesize -> Viz/Method: Structured text with clear typography and layout -> Interaction: None. -> Justification: For abstract concepts, readability and clarity are paramount. -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind.

                    This application explores a profound and beautiful hypothesis: that our universe is not an isolated event, but a living node within a vast, interconnected, and potentially intelligent cosmic mycelial network. This is not a theory to be proven, but a foundational story—a mythos—to be tested against the sum of human knowledge. Its value lies not in probability, but in its "ontological resonance": its power to make our existence more coherent, meaningful, and alive. Use the tools below to explore the deep, structural similarities between this grand idea and the discoveries of our science, the logic of our biology, and the wisdom of our spiritual traditions.
