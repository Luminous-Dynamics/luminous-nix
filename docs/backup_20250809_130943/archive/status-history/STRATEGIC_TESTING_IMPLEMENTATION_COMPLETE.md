- **Target Coverage**: 0% → 95% (92 lines)
- **Test Classes**: 10 comprehensive test suites
- **Focus**: Terminal experience, accessibility, performance

## 📊 Expected Coverage Impact

```yaml
Before Implementation:
  Overall Coverage: ~60%
  TUI App: 0% (192 lines uncovered)
  CLI Adapter: 0% (92 lines uncovered)
  High-impact gap: 284 lines

After Implementation:
  Overall Coverage: ~85% (25% increase)

  CLI Adapter: 95% (87 lines covered)
  Coverage gain: 269 lines (22% of codebase)
```

## 🌟 Revolutionary Testing Approach

### Consciousness-First Testing Philosophy
- **User Experience Centered**: Every test validates real user benefits
- **All 10 Personas Covered**: Maya (ADHD), Grandma Rose, Alex (blind), etc.
- **Accessibility Native**: Screen reader, keyboard navigation built-in
- **Performance Budgets**: <1s for Maya, <2s for Grandma Rose

### Sacred Trinity Integration
- **Human (User Empathy)**: Tests reflect real user scenarios
- **Claude (Architecture)**: Comprehensive coverage with clean design
- **Local LLM (Domain Knowledge)**: NixOS-specific functionality tested
