# üêï Dogfooding Checklist - Nix for Humanity

*Eating our own dog food: Real scenarios for daily NixOS usage*

## üéØ Pre-Flight Setup

### Make It Your Default
- [ ] Add to PATH: `export PATH="/srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/nix-for-humanity/bin:$PATH"`
- [ ] Create alias: `alias nix='ask-nix'`
- [ ] Remove safety net: Hide regular nix commands for a day
- [ ] Set up quick feedback: `alias feedback='echo "$(date): " >> FEEDBACK_CAPTURE.md && vim FEEDBACK_CAPTURE.md'`

### Mental Preparation
- [ ] Commit to using ONLY Nix for Humanity for one full day
- [ ] Promise to log EVERY friction point
- [ ] Accept that you might get less done
- [ ] Remember: Your frustration = user frustration

## üì± Daily Scenarios

### Morning Routine (First 30 mins)
- [ ] Check for system updates
  ```bash
  ask-nix "are there any updates available?"
  ask-nix "what packages would be updated?"
  ```
- [ ] Install something you need for today's work
  ```bash
  ask-nix "install [tool you actually need]"
  ```
- [ ] Check system health
  ```bash
  ask-nix "how's my system doing?"
  ask-nix "am I low on disk space?"
  ```

### Development Work
- [ ] Set up a new project environment
  ```bash
  ask-nix "I need python with numpy and pandas"
  ask-nix "create a shell for rust development"
  ```
- [ ] Debug a build failure
  ```bash
  ask-nix "why is my build failing?"
  ask-nix "missing dependency libssl"
  ```
- [ ] Search for development tools
  ```bash
  ask-nix "what text editors are available?"
  ask-nix "find me a JSON formatter"
  ```

### System Administration
- [ ] Enable a service
  ```bash
  ask-nix "enable docker"
  ask-nix "start postgresql"
  ```
- [ ] Check service status
  ```bash
  ask-nix "is nginx running?"
  ask-nix "why did mysql fail to start?"
  ```
- [ ] User management
  ```bash
  ask-nix "add me to the docker group"
  ask-nix "list users in wheel group"
  ```

### Troubleshooting
- [ ] Fix broken packages
  ```bash
  ask-nix "firefox won't start"
  ask-nix "rebuild with latest packages"
  ```
- [ ] Rollback after problems
  ```bash
  ask-nix "go back to yesterday's configuration"
  ask-nix "what changed in the last update?"
  ```
- [ ] Debug hardware issues
  ```bash
  ask-nix "my wifi isn't working"
  ask-nix "no sound from speakers"
  ```

### End of Day Cleanup
- [ ] Clean up disk space
  ```bash
  ask-nix "clean up old generations"
  ask-nix "remove unused packages"
  ```
- [ ] Review what was installed
  ```bash
  ask-nix "what did I install today?"
  ask-nix "show my recent changes"
  ```

## üé≠ Persona Testing

### Be Grandma Rose (75, non-technical)
- [ ] Try voice commands (if working)
- [ ] Use simplest possible language
- [ ] Get confused on purpose
- [ ] See if help is actually helpful
- [ ] Time: 30 minutes

### Be Maya (16, ADHD, needs speed)
- [ ] Demand instant responses
- [ ] Try rapid-fire commands
- [ ] Get impatient with delays
- [ ] Multitask aggressively
- [ ] Time: 30 minutes

### Be Dr. Sarah (35, precision-focused)
- [ ] Ask for exact package versions
- [ ] Demand detailed explanations
- [ ] Verify every operation
- [ ] Check documentation accuracy
- [ ] Time: 30 minutes

## üî• Stress Tests

### The "Everything is Broken" Test
- [ ] Intentionally break something
- [ ] Try to fix it using only ask-nix
- [ ] Time how long it takes
- [ ] Note when you give up

### The "New User" Test
- [ ] Delete all your nix knowledge
- [ ] Start with "help"
- [ ] Try to do basic tasks
- [ ] Note every confusion

### The "Production Emergency" Test
- [ ] Simulate urgent situation
- [ ] Need to fix something NOW
- [ ] Can ask-nix help or does it slow you down?
- [ ] Would you trust it in production?

### The "Teaching Someone" Test
- [ ] Actually show it to someone
- [ ] Let them try it
- [ ] Note where they struggle
- [ ] See if they'd use it again

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Time these common operations:

| Operation | Native Command Time | ask-nix Time | Acceptable? |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Search package | _____ sec | _____ sec | Y/N |
| Install package | _____ sec | _____ sec | Y/N |
| List generations | _____ sec | _____ sec | Y/N |
| Update system | _____ min | _____ min | Y/N |
| Get help | instant | _____ sec | Y/N |

## üö´ The "Never Touched" List

Check off features you NEVER used during dogfooding:

- [ ] Voice interface
- [ ] TUI (Textual interface)
- [ ] Persona switching
- [ ] Learning system
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] Advanced queries
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation
- [ ] Context awareness
- [ ] Predictive suggestions
- [ ] Natural error recovery

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Day 1 - Survival
- [ ] Completed morning routine without regular commands
- [ ] Didn't rage quit before lunch
- [ ] Found at least 3 things that work well
- [ ] Logged at least 10 friction points

### Day 3 - Adaptation
- [ ] Starting to remember syntax
- [ ] Found workarounds for major issues
- [ ] Completed real work tasks
- [ ] Trust it for non-critical operations

### Day 7 - Integration
- [ ] Prefer it for some operations
- [ ] Miss it when not available
- [ ] Recommend specific features to others
- [ ] See clear path to improvement

### Day 14 - Validation
- [ ] Use it without thinking
- [ ] Trust it for important tasks
- [ ] Actually saves time for some workflows
- [ ] Would be upset if it disappeared

## üíî Brutal Honesty Section

After each dogfooding session, answer:

1. **Would I use this if I didn't build it?**
   - [ ] Yes
   - [ ] No
   - [ ] Only for: ________________

2. **Would I recommend it to a friend?**
   - [ ] Yes, enthusiastically
   - [ ] Yes, with major caveats
   - [ ] No, not yet

3. **What made me want to quit?**
   ```
   
   
   
   ```

4. **What surprised me positively?**
   ```
   
   
   
   ```

5. **The ONE thing to fix first:**
   ```
   
   ```

## üèÅ Final Validation

After 2 weeks of dogfooding:

- [ ] I trust it with my daily work
- [ ] It saves me time overall
- [ ] I'd miss it if it was gone
- [ ] I've shown it to others voluntarily
- [ ] It delivers on at least ONE core promise

If you can't check at least 3 of these, it's not ready for users.
