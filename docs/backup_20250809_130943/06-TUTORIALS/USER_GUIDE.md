## üë• Personalized Sections

### üåπ For Grandma Rose (and anyone new to computers)

**Hi! Don't worry - this is designed to be as friendly as talking to a helpful grandchild.**

#### Getting Started
You don't need to memorize anything. Just describe what you want:

```
"I want to browse the internet"
"I need something to look at photos"
"How do I send email?"
"My screen is too small to read"
```

#### Your Best Features
- **Voice commands** (coming soon!) - Just speak naturally
- **Simple language** - No confusing technical terms
- **Patient responses** - Take your time, no rushing
- **Step-by-step help** - One thing at a time

#### Example Conversation
```
You: "I want to video call my family"
System: "I can help you set up video calling! The easiest option is Skype. 
         Should I install that for you?"
You: "Yes please"
System: "Installing Skype... Done! I'll show you how to use it next."
```

#### Tips Just for You
- Ask "what does that mean?" for any confusing words
- Say "go slower" if things move too fast
- It's okay to ask the same question multiple times
- The computer will never get impatient with you

### ‚ö° For Maya (and anyone with ADHD)

**Fast, focused, no fluff. Let's get stuff done.**

#### Your Optimized Experience
```bash
# Lightning-fast minimal mode
ask-nix --minimal "install discord"

# Quick info, no explanations
ask-nix --fast "update system"

# Just the command to copy-paste
ask-nix --command-only "install vscode"
```

#### Speed Features Made for You
- **Sub-2-second responses** - No waiting around
- **Minimal visual clutter** - Clean, focused interface
- **Direct answers** - Skip the explanations unless you ask
- **Quick corrections** - Fix mistakes instantly

#### Example (Maya Style)
```
You: "firefox"
System: "Installing Firefox... Done."

You: "discord spotify obs"
System: "Installing 3 packages... All done."

You: "oops not obs, remove it"
System: "Removed OBS."
```

#### ADHD-Friendly Tips
- Use single words when you're in a hurry: "firefox", "update", "wifi"
- Chain commands: "install firefox discord spotify"
- The system remembers context, so "no wait, vim instead" works
- Set it to minimal mode if default feels too chatty

*Sacred Humility Context: This comprehensive user guide represents our current understanding of effective multi-persona communication design for consciousness-first AI systems. While our 10-persona adaptation approach and natural language patterns have proven effective within our development and testing environment, the broader applicability of our user interaction methodologies across diverse real-world contexts, technical backgrounds, and communication preferences requires validation through extensive usage by diverse user communities. Our persona-based design patterns reflect our specific research context and may require refinement based on actual user behavior patterns, cultural communication differences, and accessibility needs that emerge beyond our current testing scope.*
