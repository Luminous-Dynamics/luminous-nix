# Nested Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up the confusing nested `docs/nix-for-humanity/` directory structure to create a single, flat docs/ structure.

## Files Moved

### To `technical/` directory:
- `ACCESSIBILITY_FRAMEWORK.md` → `technical/NIX_ACCESSIBILITY_FRAMEWORK.md`
- `TECHNICAL.md` → `technical/NIX_TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`
- `NLP_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `technical/NIX_NLP_ARCHITECTURE.md` (different from existing)

### To `development/` directory:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DEVELOPMENT.md` → `development/NIX_CLAUDE_CODE_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` → `development/NIX_DEVELOPMENT.md` (different from existing)

### To `operations/` directory:
- `OPERATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE_UPDATE.md` → `operations/NIX_OPERATIONAL_INTELLIGENCE_UPDATE.md`

### To `guides/` directory:
- `START_HERE.md` → `guides/NIX_START_HERE.md`
- `USER_GUIDE.md` → `guides/NIX_USER_GUIDE.md` (different from existing)

### To `philosophy/` directory:
- `VISION.md` → `philosophy/NIX_VISION.md`
- `VISION_UNIFIED.md` → `philosophy/NIX_VISION_UNIFIED.md`

### To `project/` directory:
- `ROADMAP.md` → `project/NIX_ROADMAP.md` (different from existing)

## Naming Convention
Files that had naming conflicts were prefixed with `NIX_` to indicate they are specific to the Nix for Humanity project.

## References to Update
Found references to the old nested structure in:
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Lines 107-108
- `docs/archive/DOCUMENTATION_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`
- `docs/archive/old-visions/NIX_FOR_HUMANITY_VISION.md`
- `docs/archive/FINAL_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`

These references should be updated to point to the new locations.

## Result
- Removed empty `docs/nix-for-humanity/` directory
- All files preserved with clear naming
- Single, flat documentation structure achieved
- No more confusion about nested directories

## Next Steps
1. Update references in the files listed above
2. Consider creating a `docs/nix-for-humanity-index.md` that lists all NIX_ prefixed files
3. Review if any build scripts or documentation generators need path updates
