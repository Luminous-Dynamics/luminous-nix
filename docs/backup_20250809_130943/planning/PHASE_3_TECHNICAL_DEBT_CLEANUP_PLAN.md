**Goal**: Replace mock implementations with functional voice processing

#### Priority 1: Pipecat Framework Integration
```python
# Current: Mock implementation in pipecat_interface.py
if PIPECAT_AVAILABLE and self.pipeline and self.transport:
    # Start the real pipecat pipeline
    await self._start_real_pipeline(on_transcript, on_response)
else:
    # Start mock pipeline for development
    await self._start_mock_pipeline(on_transcript, on_response)
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install and configure pipecat framework dependencies

#### Priority 2: Model Management System
```python
# Current: Placeholder model paths
def _get_whisper_model_path(self) -> Path:
    # In real implementation, this would download/locate the appropriate model
    models_dir = self.data_dir / "models" / "whisper"
