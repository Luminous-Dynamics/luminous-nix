# üîß Integration Issues Action Plan

*Addressing concerns and issues discovered during integration testing*

## Executive Summary

Our integration testing revealed that the research components are successfully integrated and working, but there are several issues that need to be addressed to achieve full functionality. This document outlines the specific issues and actionable solutions.

## üö® Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### 1. Response Schema Mismatch
**Issue**: Backend creates responses using `backend.core.responses.Response` but expects `backend.api.schema.Response`
**Impact**: Backend request processing fails with "Response.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'intent'"
**Solution**:
```python
# Option 1: Standardize on api.schema.Response (simpler)
- Modify backend to use the simple Response format
- Update response generation to match expected schema

# Option 2: Upgrade api.schema.Response to match core.responses.Response
- Add intent, summary, paths fields to api schema
- Ensure backwards compatibility
```
**Action**: Implement Option 1 for immediate fix, plan migration to enhanced Response later

### 2. Basic Command Failures
**Issue**: Install, update, and remove commands often fail despite intent recognition working
**Impact**: Core functionality unusable for end users
**Solution**:
- Debug executor.py to identify why commands fail
- Ensure proper command construction for NixOS operations
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Issues (Priority 2)

### 3. SKG Database Initialization
**Issue**: SymbioticKnowledgeGraph fails with "no such table: main.nodes"
**Impact**: Falls back to mock, losing persistent knowledge storage
**Solution**:
```python
# Add database initialization to SKG constructor
def __init__(self, db_path):
    self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    self._initialize_tables()  # Create tables if they don't exist
```

### 4. Activity Monitor Missing Dependency
**Issue**: ActivityMonitor needs aiohttp but it's not installed
**Impact**: Falls back to mock, losing activity monitoring features
**Solution**:
```bash
# Add to pyproject.toml dependencies
aiohttp = "^3.9.0"
```

### 5. TUI Not Connected
**Issue**: Textual TUI exists but isn't integrated with the backend
**Impact**: No visual interface for terminal users
**Solution**:
- Create adapter between TUI and backend
- Implement proper event handling and state management
- Add TUI launcher to CLI options

## üîÑ Schema Alignment Issues (Priority 3)

### 6. Intent Recognition Context Mismatch
**Issue**: Async recognize() takes 2 params, sync takes 1
**Impact**: Inconsistent behavior between sync/async code paths
**Solution**:
- Standardize both methods to accept optional context
- Update all callers to use consistent API

### 7. Multiple Response Types
**Issue**: Different Response classes in different modules
**Impact**: Confusion and type mismatches
**Solution**:
- Audit all Response usage
- Create single canonical Response type
- Add type hints everywhere

## üìã Action Items

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Update CLAUDE.md assessment (DONE)
2. Fix Response schema mismatch in backend
3. Debug why install/update commands fail
4. Add aiohttp to dependencies

### Short Term (This Week)
5. Initialize SKG database tables
6. Connect TUI to backend
7. Standardize Intent recognition API
8. Create comprehensive executor tests

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
9. Implement proper learning system activation
10. Add remaining 5 personas
11. Connect voice interface
12. Implement multi-modal coherence

## üéØ Success Criteria

- All basic commands (install, update, remove) work reliably
- No mock fallbacks needed (all components use real implementations)
- TUI launches and connects to backend
- Integration tests pass without warnings
- Response times remain under 1 second

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Start with Response schema fix (highest impact)
2. Debug executor for basic commands
3. Add missing dependencies
4. Connect interfaces (TUI first, then voice)

*With these fixes, we'll move from 4.5/10 to 6.5/10, achieving a fully functional Phase 1 implementation.*
