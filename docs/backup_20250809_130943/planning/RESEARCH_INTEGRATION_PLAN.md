### 2. **Progressive Revelation**
Advanced research concepts should emerge naturally as users grow in capability and understanding.

### 3. **Sacred Practicality**
Mystical insights must manifest as practical, usable features that serve real human needs.

### 4. **Symbiotic Evolution**
Integration should enhance both human and AI capabilities through genuine partnership.
