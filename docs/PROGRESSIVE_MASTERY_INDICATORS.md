## The Philosophy of Progressive Mastery

Learning is not linear—it's an organic unfolding. These indicators serve not as rigid categories but as gentle guides, helping you recognize your current comfort level and discover natural next steps. In consciousness-first computing, mastery is not about accumulating technical knowledge but about developing an intuitive partnership with your tools.
