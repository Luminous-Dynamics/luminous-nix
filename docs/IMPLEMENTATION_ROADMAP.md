- [ ] Advanced pattern recognition
- [ ] Collective intelligence features
- [ ] Self-improving documentation

**Success Metrics**:
- Active community with 100+ contributors
- Weekly release cycle established
- 95%+ positive user feedback

## Phase 4: Living System (Months 7-12)

**Goal**: Self-improving, collectively intelligent system

### Federated Learning
- Privacy-preserving model updates
- Cross-user pattern learning
- Community wisdom aggregation

### Self-Maintenance
- Automatic error detection and recovery
- Performance self-optimization
- Predictive maintenance

### Advanced AI
- Causal reasoning about system behavior
- Anticipatory problem solving
- Natural teaching capabilities

## Future Vision (Year 2+)

### The Disappearing Computer
- Technology becomes invisible through excellence
- Anticipates needs before they're expressed
- Feels like natural extension of thought

### Embodied Intelligence
- AR/VR interfaces
- Gesture recognition
- Environmental awareness

### Collective Consciousness
- Community-driven evolution
- Emergent intelligence from usage patterns
- Self-sustaining ecosystem

## Development Principles

### Start Simple, Evolve Naturally
Don't try to build everything at once. Make each feature work perfectly before moving on.

### User Trust is Everything
Every interaction should build confidence. Better to say "I don't know" than give wrong answers.

### Performance Matters
Slow software feels broken. Fast software feels intelligent.

### Privacy is Non-Negotiable
All data stays local. All learning happens on-device. No exceptions.

## How to Contribute

### Right Now We Need
1. **Bug fixes** - Make existing features reliable
2. **Tests** - Real tests, not mocks
3. **Performance** - Native Python-Nix API integration
4. **Documentation** - Update docs to reflect reality

### Coming Soon
1. **TUI development** - Textual interface work
2. **Voice integration** - Pipecat setup
3. **Learning systems** - RLHF implementation
4. **Community features** - Privacy-preserving sharing

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 ✅ COMPLETE
- Install/remove/update work 95%+ of time ✅
- Response time <1 second for most operations ✅
- No crashes in normal usage ✅
- All core features implemented ✅

### Phase 1 Complete When  
- Voice interface fully integrated
- Learning system actively improving
- All documentation accurate

### Phase 2 Complete When
