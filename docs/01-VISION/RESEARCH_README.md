## Key Technical Decisions

Based on this research, we've made several architectural decisions:

### 1. **Unified Backend Pattern**
- Single Python backend serving multiple frontends
- Direct nixos-rebuild-ng API integration
- Tiered IPC strategy for different operation types

### 2. **AI Model Selection**
- **Speech**: Whisper (STT) + Piper (TTS)
- **NLP**: spaCy + SentenceTransformers
- **ML**: Scikit-learn for pattern recognition
- **Future**: Local GGUF models via llama.cpp

### 3. **Interface Architecture**
- **Terminal**: Textual framework for modern TUI
- **Voice**: Low-latency pipeline with VAD
- **GUI**: Tauri for future desktop app
- **API**: FastAPI for third-party integration

## Implementation Priorities

Based on research findings:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ‚úÖ Python backend with nixos-rebuild-ng
- ‚úÖ Basic multi-model AI integration
- üöß Textual TUI prototype

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Next)
