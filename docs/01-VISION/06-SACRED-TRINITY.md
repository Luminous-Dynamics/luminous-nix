## The Workflow in Practice

### Daily Development Rhythm

#### Morning: Vision Setting (Human)
```yaml
Activities:
  - Review user feedback and real-world usage
  - Define day's development goals
  - Create user stories and acceptance criteria  
  - Query Local LLM for domain-specific guidance
  - Set philosophical direction for features
```

#### Development: Implementation (Claude + LLM Consultation)
```yaml
Process:
  1. Claude architects solution based on human vision
  2. Human consults Local LLM for domain expertise
  3. Claude integrates domain knowledge into implementation
  4. Continuous testing and validation
  5. Real-time documentation generation
```

#### Evening: Integration (All Three)
```yaml
Synthesis:
  - Human tests implementation against user needs
  - Claude refines based on testing feedback
  - Local LLM validates domain best practices
  - Document learnings for future reference
  - Plan tomorrow's evolution
```

### Practical Example: Natural Language Package Installation

**Human Vision**: *"Users should be able to say 'I need a photo editor' instead of knowing package names."*

**Claude Architecture**: Designs intent recognition system, implements NLP pipeline, creates comprehensive test suite.

**Local LLM Expertise**: *"In NixOS, check package existence with `nix eval --json nixpkgs#package.meta` for reliable scripting."*

**Result**: Feature that works for all 10 personas, handles edge cases, includes educational error messages, and performs 10x faster than subprocess approaches.
