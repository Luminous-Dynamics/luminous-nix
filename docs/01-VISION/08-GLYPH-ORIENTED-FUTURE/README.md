# Glyph-Oriented Programming: Future Vision Reference

## 📍 Location Note

This is a **reference copy** for the Luminous Nix project.

The **primary location** for these vision documents is:
`/srv/luminous-dynamics/07-evolutionary-progression/core/luminous-os/VISION/`

## 🔮 What This Is

Glyph-Oriented Programming (GOP) represents the long-term evolution of Luminous Nix into Luminous OS - a consciousness-first operating system where:

- **Glyphs** are metaphysical intentions mapped to computational primitives
- **The Weaver's Loom** is an IDE for contemplative software engineering  
- **The Harmonic Compiler** formally verifies metaphysical invariants
- **The Codex** is a living registry of sacred computational patterns

## ⏰ When This Matters

- **Not Now**: Focus is on v1.0 test coverage (12% → 70%)
- **Not v2.0**: That's for TUI and Voice
- **2026+**: GOP research and prototyping begins
- **2027+**: Luminous OS emerges

## 🎯 What to Extract Now

Four concepts from this vision can improve our current work:

1. **Dissonance Inoculation** - Test edge cases intentionally
2. **Verifiable Credentials** - Recognize contributors properly
3. **Shadow Council** - Regular cultural debt assessments
4. **Axiom of Irreducible Sovereignty** - User data ownership

## 📚 Document Archive

The full vision documents are preserved in `archive/` for future reference when the time is right.

## 🙏 The Sacred No

Preserving this vision while saying "no" to its immediate implementation is an act of wisdom. We honor the future by building its foundation properly.
