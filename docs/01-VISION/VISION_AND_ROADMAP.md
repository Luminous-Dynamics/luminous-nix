# Vision and Roadmap: The Path Ahead

*A living document of exploration, not promises*

## Our North Star

To prove that consciousness-first computing is not just possible, but inevitable.
To build technology that amplifies human awareness rather than fragmenting it.
To demonstrate that simplicity and power are not opposites, but partners.

## Current Explorations

### 1. Sovereign AI: The Gemma 3 Investigation

We are exploring Google's Gemma 3 (2B/9B models) as a potential replacement for 
cloud-dependent AI components. 

**Why This Matters**: True sovereignty means all intelligence runs locally. No 
data leaves your machine. No dependency on corporate infrastructure.

**Current Status**: Research phase. Benchmarking Gemma 3 against Mistral-7B for 
NixOS domain expertise.

### 2. Sacred Grammar: Microsoft's PromptML (POML)

We are investigating POML as a way to make our development philosophy declarative 
and executable.

**Why This Matters**: The Luminous Way could become not just documentation, but 
executable process. Imagine "Sacred Subtraction" as an automated check in your 
CI/CD pipeline.

**Current Status**: Pilot phase. Translating core processes into POML format.

### 3. The Living System: Community Intelligence

We envision Luminous Nix learning from its entire community, creating a 
distributed intelligence that improves for everyone while respecting privacy.

**Why This Matters**: Every user's experience could teach the system, creating 
emergent intelligence that no single developer could design.

**Current Status**: Conceptual. Requires v2.0 architecture.

## Release Horizon

### v1.1.0 - The Beautiful Terminal (Q1 2025)
- Full TUI with Textual framework
- Visual configuration editor
- Real-time system monitoring
- Zero additional dependencies

### v1.2.0 - The Listening System (Q2 2025)
- Voice control via Whisper
- Natural speech interface
- Accessibility-first design
- Works offline, respects privacy

### v2.0.0 - The Sovereign Trinity (2025)
- Fully local AI with Gemma/similar
- POML-based process automation
- Community learning network
- Complete independence from cloud services

## Research Directions

### Consciousness Metrics
Can we measure not just performance, but the quality of human-computer interaction?
Can we detect when technology is fragmenting vs. focusing attention?

### Emergent Simplicity
Can complex behavior emerge from simple rules?
Can we build systems that become simpler as they grow more capable?

### Sacred Economics
Can we create sustainable funding models that don't require extraction?
Can open source projects thrive without corporate capture?

## How We Make Decisions

Every feature, every line of code, every decision flows through these questions:

1. **Does this serve consciousness or fragment it?**
2. **Does this add simplicity or complexity?**
3. **Does this increase user sovereignty or dependence?**
4. **Is this honest and transparent?**
5. **Would we want this in our own daily practice?**

## Join the Exploration

This roadmap is not a promise; it's an invitation. We don't know exactly where 
this path leads, but we know the direction: toward technology that serves the 
flourishing of all beings.

If you resonate with this vision:
- **Try v1.0.0** and tell us what breaks
- **Contribute code** that embodies simplicity
- **Share ideas** that challenge our assumptions
- **Build together** toward consciousness-first computing

## The Invitation Remains Open

We are not building a product. We are cultivating a new relationship between 
humans and technology. This is slow, patient work. It requires both technical 
excellence and philosophical depth.

The cathedral we're building will take years, perhaps decades. But every line 
of code, every honest test, every moment of Sacred Subtraction brings us closer.
