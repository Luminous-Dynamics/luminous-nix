    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard, not a linear document. It uses a sticky navigation bar for non-linear exploration of four key thematic sections: 1) Paradigm Shifts (interactive cards for drill-down), 2) Model Refinements (tabbed interface to manage detail), 3) The Sentient Garden (interactive diagram for architectural exploration), and 4) The Roadmap (visual timeline with a chart). This structure was chosen to break down complex, interconnected concepts into manageable, engaging modules, facilitating user understanding and exploration over passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Paradigm Shifts: Report info (4 shifts) -> Goal (Inform/Compare) -> Viz (Interactive Cards) -> Interaction (Click to expand) -> Justification (Encourages focused learning) -> Method (HTML/JS). 2. Refinements: Report info (3 model types) -> Goal (Organize) -> Viz (Tabbed content) -> Interaction (Click tabs) -> Justification (Prevents information overload) -> Method (HTML/JS). 3. Architecture: Report info (5 layers) -> Goal (Relationships/Organize) -> Viz (Clickable Diagram) -> Interaction (Click layer to show details) -> Justification (Visualizes hierarchy and connections effectively) -> Method (HTML/JS). 4. Roadmap: Report info (3 phases) -> Goal (Change/Compare) -> Viz (Timeline + Bar Chart) -> Interaction (None, static view) -> Justification (Provides clear temporal and priority overview) -> Method (Chart.js). -->
