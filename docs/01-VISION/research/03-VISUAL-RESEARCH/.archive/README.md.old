## Purpose

Visual research helps communicate complex concepts through diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics. These materials are invaluable for:
- Explaining architecture to stakeholders
- Onboarding new developers
- Planning implementation phases
- Documenting system design

## How to Use

1. Open HTML files in a web browser for best viewing
2. Reference when explaining concepts to others
3. Use as blueprints for implementation
4. Include in presentations and documentation

## Key Insight

A picture is worth a thousand words, especially when explaining revolutionary AI architectures. These visuals bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete implementation.
