## Original Documentation


*Exploring distributed architectures for resilient human-AI ecosystems*

## Overview

This category contains research on decentralized and distributed systems that support the Nix-for-Humanity vision of local-first, privacy-preserving, collectively intelligent technology.

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Governance Models
- Alternatives to nation-state structures
- Distributed decision-making frameworks
- Community-driven governance patterns

### 2. Technical Architecture
- Hybrid blockchain implementations
- Distributed ledger technologies
- Peer-to-peer networking patterns

### 3. System Transitions
- Graceful migration from centralized systems
- Backwards compatibility strategies
- Progressive decentralization paths

### 4. Real-World Applications
- Decentralized justice systems
- Distributed energy networks
- Community-owned infrastructure

## Connection to Nix-for-Humanity

These research documents inform:
- **Federated Learning Architecture** - Phase 4 collective intelligence
- **Privacy-Preserving Design** - Local-first principles
- **Community Features** - Distributed wisdom sharing
- **Self-Sustaining Systems** - Autonomous operation patterns

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 4+**: These concepts primarily apply to the Living System phase where Nix-for-Humanity evolves into a self-sustaining, collectively intelligent ecosystem.
