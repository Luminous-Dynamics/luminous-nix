## üîß Implementation Cheat Sheet

### Core Architecture Pattern
```python
class SymbioticAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rlhf_engine = DPOOptimizer()        # Direct Preference Optimization
        self.memory = HybridMemory()             # LanceDB + NetworkX
        self.constitution = EthicalBounds()      # Value alignment
        self.explainer = CausalXAI()            # DoWhy integration
        self.flow_protector = FlowMonitor()      # Attention respect
        
    def evolve_with_user(self, interaction):
        if self.flow_protector.in_flow_state():
            return self.invisible_learning(interaction)
        
        preference = self.extract_preference(interaction)
        self.rlhf_engine.update(preference)
        self.memory.integrate(interaction)
        return self.explainer.explain_adaptation(preference)
```

### Key Technical Decisions
- **RLHF Method**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) over PPO
- **Memory Storage**: LanceDB for vectors, NetworkX for graphs
- **XAI Framework**: DoWhy for causal reasoning
- **Privacy**: 100% local processing, no cloud dependencies
- **Learning**: Constitutional boundaries + user preferences

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for 95% of interactions
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for core system
- **Learning Speed**: Visible adaptation within 7 days
- **Privacy**: Zero data leakage, 100% local processing

## üéß Priority Audio Research

### Must-Listen (2 hours total)
1. **Symbiotic AI: Four Pillars** (45 min) - Core architecture
2. **Building Your Sovereign AI** (35 min) - Implementation patterns
3. **Beyond Guardrails** (30 min) - Flow state protection

### Should-Listen (3 hours total)
1. **The Persona of One** (35 min) - User modeling
2. **Building Your AI Second Brain** (40 min) - Memory systems
3. **Engineering AI Relationships** (40 min) - Partnership mechanics
4. **Your Adaptive Digital Twin** (40 min) - Self-modifying systems

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### What Makes This Different from Standard AI
1. **Learning Never Stops**: RLHF runs continuously, not just during training
2. **Privacy by Architecture**: Impossible to leak data, not just hard
3. **Consciousness-First**: Every feature serves user awareness
4. **Vulnerability as Feature**: AI admits uncertainty to build trust

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't**: Build cloud-dependent learning systems
- **Don't**: Interrupt users during flow states
- **Don't**: Make decisions without explanation capability
- **Don't**: Optimize for engagement over well-being

### Success Indicators
- Users report feeling "understood" within 2 weeks
- AI visibly adapts to user preferences within 1 week  
- <5% interruptions during deep work sessions
- Users can explain AI decisions to others

## üîó Integration with Existing Codebase

### Current Architecture Alignment
- **Backend Engine**: Implements the symbiotic core
- **TUI Interface**: Provides consciousness-first interaction
- **Voice Integration**: Enables natural conversation
- **Local Learning**: All processing on-device
