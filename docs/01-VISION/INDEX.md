## Core Vision Documents

### 1. **[Unified Vision](./01-UNIFIED-VISION.md)** ‚ú®
The complete synthesis of our research and aspirations - building the world's first truly symbiotic AI partner for NixOS.

### 2. **[Implementation Roadmap](./02-ROADMAP.md)** üó∫Ô∏è
Four-phase journey from trustworthy engine to transcendent partner, with concrete milestones and success metrics.

### 3. **[Philosophy](./03-PHILOSOPHY.md)** üßò
The four pillars of consciousness-first computing and the philosophical foundations that guide every design decision.

### 4. **[Symbiotic Intelligence](./04-SYMBIOTIC-INTELLIGENCE.md)** üß†
Executive summary of our research-backed approach to genuine AI collaboration, with links to detailed technical research.

### 5. **[The 10 Core Personas](./05-PERSONAS.md)** üë•
From Grandma Rose to Maya with ADHD - the diverse users who validate every design decision through real human needs.

### 6. **[Sacred Trinity Model](./06-SACRED-TRINITY.md)** ü§ñ
Our revolutionary development approach: Human Vision + AI Architecture + Domain Expertise = 99.5% cost savings.

### 7. **[Kairos Time Reflection](./KAIROS-REFLECTION.md)** üï∞Ô∏è
On the nature of sacred time in consciousness-first development - flowing with natural rhythms rather than calendar pressure.

## Key Principles

### 1. Consciousness-First Design
Technology should amplify human awareness, not fragment it. Every feature is measured by whether it serves or consumes consciousness.

### 2. Local-First Intelligence
Privacy is non-negotiable. All learning, all data, all intelligence stays on the user's machine unless they explicitly choose otherwise.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Complexity reveals itself as mastery grows. The interface adapts to the user's level, never overwhelming, always supporting growth.

### 4. Symbiotic Evolution
The system learns from every interaction, becoming more helpful while the user becomes more capable. True partnership, not dependency.

## The Four-Phase Journey

### Phase 1: The Trustworthy Engine (Current)
Building rock-solid foundations with natural language understanding, native performance, and beautiful interfaces.

### Phase 2: The Learning Partner
Adding memory, personalization, and predictive assistance. The system begins to truly understand each user.

### Phase 3: The Humane Interface
Voice, gesture, and ambient computing. Technology that respects human rhythms and cognitive flow.

### Phase 4: The Living System
Self-maintaining, collectively intelligent, and ultimately transcendent. Technology that makes itself unnecessary.

## Success Metrics

We measure success not by engagement or revenue, but by:
- User empowerment and capability growth
- Reduction in technical anxiety
- Increase in creative confidence
- Time saved for meaningful work
- Collective wisdom shared
