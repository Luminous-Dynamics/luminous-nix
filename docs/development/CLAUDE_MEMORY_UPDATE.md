### 2. Partnership Evolution Stages

```markdown
## 🌱 Partnership Evolution Model

Nix for Humanity develops through four stages:

1. **Foundation (Months 1-3)** - AI learns user's language
2. **Growth (Months 4-6)** - AI adapts to user's patterns  
3. **Harmony (Months 7-9)** - AI anticipates user's needs
4. **Transcendence (Months 10-12)** - AI becomes second nature

Current Status: Foundation Stage (Month 2)
```

### 3. Documentation Standards

```markdown
## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Language Patterns
- Always refer to AI as "partner" not "tool" or "assistant"
- Use "natural language" not "commands"
- Frame errors as learning opportunities
- Emphasize user sovereignty and choice

### Required Sections
Every document should include:
- Brief overview
- Table of contents (if >3 sections)
- Related documents links
- Last updated date
- Target audience

### Review Schedule
- Technical docs: Monthly updates
- User docs: Quarterly updates  
- Philosophy docs: Annual review
- Status/Roadmap: Weekly updates
```

### 4. Testing Patterns

```markdown
## 🧪 Testing Focus

### Partnership Behavior Tests
- Test AI learning from user patterns
- Test preference persistence
- Test error recovery conversations
- Test trust building over time

### Always Test
- Natural language variations
- User corrections and learning
- Privacy controls
- Accessibility features
```

### 5. Critical Missing Documentation

```markdown
## 📋 Documentation Gaps to Fill

### High Priority
- API_REFERENCE.md - Complete API documentation
- TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md - How to test AI partnerships
- DEPLOYMENT.md - Production deployment guide
- GLOSSARY.md - Technical terms explained
- MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Version upgrades

### User Stories Needed
- First-time user journey
- Developer integration story  
- Privacy-conscious user story
- Accessibility user story
```

### 6. Development Workflow Update

```markdown
## 🔄 Documentation Workflow

For every feature/change:
1. Update relevant user guide section
2. Update API reference if needed
3. Add/update examples
4. Update troubleshooting guide
5. Test all code examples
6. Review for partnership language
7. Update CHANGELOG.md
8. Check related document links
```

### 7. Key Philosophical Points

```markdown
## 💫 Core Philosophy Reminders

### The AI Partnership Is:
- A learning relationship, not a tool
- Transparent about what it knows
- Respectful of user sovereignty  
- Privacy-first in all operations
- Designed to eventually disappear

### Documentation Should:
- Emphasize natural conversation
- Show AI learning and growth
- Respect user autonomy
- Be accessible to all
- Focus on partnership success
```

## Quick Reference Commands for Claude

When working on Nix for Humanity:

```bash
# Check documentation structure
ls -la docs/

# Find all instances of old terminology
grep -r "GUI" docs/ | grep -v archive
grep -r "tool" docs/ | grep -v archive  
grep -r "command" docs/ | grep -v archive

# Update documentation status
echo "Last Updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> docs/project/STATUS.md

# Test documentation examples
npm run docs:test

# Check for broken links
npm run docs:check-links
```

## Remember for Every Session

1. **Check documentation currency** - Is it up to date?
2. **Maintain partnership focus** - Does it reflect AI as partner?
3. **Test examples** - Do code examples actually work?
4. **Cross-reference** - Are related docs linked?
5. **Accessibility** - Can everyone understand this?
