# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy - Nix for Humanity

## Our Security Commitment

Nix for Humanity handles voice data, system commands, and user intentions. We take this responsibility seriously and implement defense-in-depth security practices to protect both your privacy and your system.

## üîê Security Model

### Local-First Architecture
- **All processing happens on your machine** - No cloud dependencies
- **Voice data never leaves your device** - Local speech recognition
- **No telemetry or analytics** - We don't track anything
- **Offline capable** - Full functionality without internet

### Sandboxed Execution

     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Checks at Every Step ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Privilege Separation
- **User-level daemon** - Runs without root privileges
- **Polkit integration** - System changes require explicit authorization
- **Command validation** - All generated commands are verified
- **Audit logging** - Complete trail of all system modifications

## üéØ Threat Model

### What We Protect Against
1. **Command Injection** - Malicious input trying to execute arbitrary commands
2. **Path Traversal** - Attempts to access unauthorized files
3. **Privilege Escalation** - Trying to gain root access
4. **Data Exfiltration** - Attempts to steal configuration or data
5. **Voice Replay** - Recording and replaying voice commands

### What's Out of Scope
- Physical access attacks
- Nation-state adversaries
- Hardware-level vulnerabilities
- Supply chain attacks on NixOS itself

## üîí Security Features

### Input Validation
```javascript
// All user input is sanitized
const validateIntent = (input) => {
  // Check for injection patterns
  if (containsMaliciousPatterns(input)) {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid input detected');
  }
  
  // Validate against whitelist
  if (!isWhitelistedIntent(input)) {
    throw new SecurityError('Unknown intent');
  }
  
  return sanitize(input);
};
```

### Command Generation Safety
- **No shell execution** - Direct Nix API calls only
- **Parameterized commands** - No string concatenation
- **Whitelist approach** - Only known-safe operations
- **Capability-based** - Users can't exceed their permissions

### Voice Security
- **Local processing** - Using Whisper or Web Speech API
- **No voice storage** - Audio immediately discarded after processing
- **Speaker verification** - Optional biometric protection
- **Anti-replay** - Timestamps prevent command replay

## üêõ Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who help us keep Nix for Humanity safe. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. **Email** security@luminousdynamics.org with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Your suggested fix (if any)

### Our Response Timeline
- **24 hours** - Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours** - Severity assessment
- **7 days** - Fix development begins
- **30 days** - Patch released (critical issues faster)

### Recognition
- Credit in release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Entry in our [Security Hall of Fame](SECURITY_HALL_OF_FAME.md)
- Potential bounty for critical findings (coming soon)

## üîç Security Hardening

### For Users

#### Basic Hardening
```nix
# configuration.nix
services.nix-for-humanity = {
  enable = true;
  security = {
    # Require authentication for system changes
    requireAuth = true;
    
    # Limit command execution rate
    rateLimit = {
      maxCommands = 100;
      perMinutes = 5;
    };
    
    # Enable audit logging
    auditLog = {
      enable = true;
      path = "/var/log/nix-for-humanity/audit.log";
    };
  };
};
```

#### Advanced Hardening
```nix
# For high-security environments
services.nix-for-humanity = {
  security = {
    # Whitelist specific operations
    allowedOperations = [
      "install-package"
      "update-system"
      "check-status"
    ];
    
    # Require two-factor for sensitive operations
    twoFactor = {
      enable = true;
      provider = "totp";
    };
    
    # Voice biometrics
    voiceAuth = {
      enable = true;
      enrollmentRequired = true;
    };
  };
};
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Development Practices
1. **Input validation** - Never trust user input
2. **Least privilege** - Request minimum permissions
3. **Fail secure** - Errors should fail safely
4. **Defense in depth** - Multiple security layers
5. **Regular audits** - Automated security scanning

#### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security test suite
npm run test:security

# Static analysis
npm run lint:security

# Dependency audit
npm audit

# Fuzzing tests
npm run test:fuzz
```
