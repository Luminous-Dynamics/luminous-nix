- **Users already comfortable with Linux**
- **Valve supports OS experimentation**
- **x86 architecture = easy port**

### Killer Features for Steam Deck:
```nix
# steam-deck-luminous.nix
{
  luminous.steamDeck = {
    enable = true;
    
    features = {
      # Voice control without internet
      voiceAssistant = {
        enable = true;
        wakeWord = "Hey Deck";
        offlineMode = true;
      };
      
      # Natural language game management
      gameManager = {
        enable = true;
        # "Install Skyrim with 50 mods"
        # "Find games like Hades"
        # "What runs at 60fps?"
      };
      
      # Smart performance profiles
      powerProfiles = {
        auto = true;  # AI-driven
        # "Optimize for 5 hour battery"
        # "Maximum performance for Cyberpunk"
      };
      
      # Cross-device sync
      cloudSync = {
        enable = true;
        # Sync with desktop NixOS
        # Share game configs
      };
    };
  };
}
```

    enable = true;
    
    # Privacy-first voice assistant
    assistant = {
      localOnly = true;  # No cloud!
      languages = ["en" "es" "fr" "de"];
    };
    
    # Convergence support
    desktop = {
      onDock = "full-kde";  # Becomes desktop when docked
      wireless = "kde-connect";

    gpu = "optional";  # Better with, works without
  };
  
  # Scales from phone to server
  scalability = {
    minimal = "CLI only";
    standard = "TUI + voice";
    full = "GUI + all features";
  };
}
```
