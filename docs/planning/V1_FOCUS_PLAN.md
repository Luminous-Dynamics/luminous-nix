# 🎯 v1.0 Focus Plan

*A clear, loving path to our first release*

## 🌟 The Sacred Focus

**One Goal**: Make `ask-nix "install firefox"` work perfectly for real users.

## 📋 v1.0 Definition of Done

A user can:
1. ✅ Install packages with natural language
2. ✅ Search for packages conversationally  
3. ✅ Update their system safely
4. ✅ Get basic help when stuck
5. ✅ Feel confident and supported

That's it. Nothing more. Do these five things exceptionally well.

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing

### Not in v1.0 (But Preserved)
- ❌ TUI with panels and graphs
- ❌ Voice commands
- ❌ Learning from user behavior
- ❌ 10 personality styles
- ❌ Metrics and analytics
- ❌ Plugin system
- ❌ Advanced AI features

### Why This Discipline Matters
Every feature we defer makes the core stronger. Users need something that works, not something that promises everything but delivers nothing.

## 📊 Success Metrics for v1.0

### Technical
- Install success rate: 95%+
- Response time: < 2 seconds
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Clear error messages: 100%

### User Experience  
- First command success: 80%+
- Users understand errors: 90%+
- Would recommend: 75%+
- "This actually helps": 100%

## 🛠️ Daily Development Flow

### Morning Sacred Practice
1. Review v1.0 focus goals
2. Pick ONE thing to improve
3. Ask: "Does this serve v1.0?"
4. If no, lovingly defer it

### Development Guidelines
- Every commit makes v1.0 better
- Test with real commands
- Write for Grandma Rose
- Celebrate small wins

### Evening Reflection
- What worked today?
- What blocked users?
- What's most important tomorrow?
- Rest with gratitude

## 💝 The Love-Based Deferral Process

When you find code for future features:

1. **Acknowledge its beauty** - This code has value
2. **Find its future home** - Which version will it serve?
3. **Move with gratitude** - Preserve in features/
4. **Document with love** - Write why it's special
5. **Return to v1.0** - Focus restored

Example:
```bash
# Found advanced TUI code
echo "This beautiful TUI will make v1.5 amazing"
mv backend/tui features/v1.5/
echo "# TUI Interface
Preserved for v1.5 when users are ready for visual beauty.
For now, we focus on making the CLI exceptional.
" > features/v1.5/tui/README.md
```

## 🌟 The Sacred Commitment

**We commit to:**
- Ship v1.0 in 2 weeks
- Only include what works perfectly
- Preserve all other work with love
- Serve real users, not our egos

**We release v1.0 when:**
- Grandma Rose can install Firefox
- Dr. Sarah trusts our explanations  
- Maya gets instant responses
- Everyone feels supported

## 🎯 Current Status Check

Run this daily:
```bash
# Check v1.0 readiness
./scripts/v1-status.sh

# Output:
# ✅ Install command: 87% success
# ⚠️ Search command: 72% success  
# ✅ Error messages: Clear
# ❌ Response time: 2.3s average
# 
# Ready for v1.0: Not yet
# Focus today: Improve search reliability
```

## 🙏 The Final Word

v1.0 is not about impressing developers. It's about helping real users accomplish real tasks with real confidence.

Every line of code asks: "Does this help someone use NixOS more easily?"

If yes, it belongs in v1.0.  
If "maybe later," preserve it with love for the future.
