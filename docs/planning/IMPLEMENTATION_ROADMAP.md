## 📅 8-Week Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundation Refactor
**Goal**: Clean pipeline architecture working end-to-end

#### Week 1: Core Pipeline
```python
# Simplify to this structure
perception/
├── base.py          # StandardizedInput class
├── textual.py       # Text input handler
└── __init__.py

cognition/
├── base.py          # Intent, ProposedIntent, ValidatedIntent
├── nlp_engine.py    # Simple pattern matching
├── validator.py     # Confidence scoring
└── __init__.py

action/
├── engine.py        # Simple orchestrator
├── registry.py      # Tool registration
└── tools/
    └── nixos.py     # Basic package operations

presentation/
├── cli.py           # Minimal CLI output
└── formatters.py    # Basic formatters
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Refactor existing code to pipeline architecture
- [ ] Remove unified_system complexity
- [ ] Create simple perception → cognition → action → presentation flow
- [ ] Basic tests for each component
- [ ] CLI working with new architecture

#### Week 2: Plugin System
```python
class Tool(ABC):
    """Base class for all tools"""
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def capabilities(self) -> List[str]:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def can_handle(self, intent: Intent) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, intent: Intent) -> Result:
        pass

class ToolRegistry:
    """Dynamic tool loading"""
    def load_tool(self, tool_class: Type[Tool]):
        tool = tool_class()
        self.tools[tool.name] = tool
        
    def find_tool_for_intent(self, intent: Intent) -> Tool:
        for tool in self.tools.values():
            if tool.can_handle(intent):
                return tool
```

**Deliverables**:

    def validate_with_user(self, proposed: ProposedIntent) -> ValidatedIntent:
        if proposed.confidence < 0.95:
            # Generate natural clarification
            question = self.generate_clarification(proposed)
            
            # Present to user (CLI first, GUI later)
            response = self.presenter.ask_user(question)
            
            if response.confirmed:
                return ValidatedIntent(proposed, user_confirmed=True)
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring

- [ ] Test various confidence scenarios

#### Week 4: Enhanced NLP
```python
class EnhancedNLPEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = self.load_patterns()
        self.fuzzy_matcher = FuzzyMatcher()
        self.entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()
    
    def recognize(self, text: str) -> ProposedIntent:
        # Multiple recognition strategies
        pattern_match = self.pattern_recognition(text)
        fuzzy_match = self.fuzzy_matching(text)
        entities = self.extract_entities(text)
        
        # Combine and score
        return self.combine_strategies(pattern_match, fuzzy_match, entities)
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Improve intent recognition accuracy

- [ ] Comprehensive NLP tests

### Week 5-6: Vision & Sacred Protocol
**Goal**: Screen awareness with absolute trust

#### Week 5: Sacred Protocol Implementation
```python
class VisionConsent:
    """Implements the four vows"""
    
    def request_session(self) -> Optional[VisionSession]:
        # 1. Explicit consent UI
        consent = self.show_consent_dialog()
        if not consent:
            return None
        
        # 2. Visual indicators
        self.activate_screen_border()
        self.show_status_icon()
        
        # 3. Time limit
        session = VisionSession(
            duration=consent.duration,
            max_duration=48  # Hard limit
        )
        
        # 4. Kill switch

    def perceive_screen(self, session: VisionSession) -> StandardizedInput:
        # Capture (in-memory only)
        screenshot = self.capture_screen()
        
        # Process immediately

src-tauri/
├── Cargo.toml       # Tauri backend
└── src/
    └── main.rs      # Bridge to Python

src/
├── App.svelte       # Main app

├── Vision.svelte    # Screen sharing controls
└── Settings.svelte  # Configuration
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Tauri project setup
- [ ] Basic Svelte components
- [ ] Python-Rust bridge
- [ ] Core screens (Dashboard, Packages, Settings)
- [ ] Persona selector

#### Week 8: Polish & Testing
**Final polish for release**

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Complete GUI styling
- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Installation package
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Demo video
- [ ] Release notes

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Language Choices
- **Core Logic**: Python (existing code, fast iteration)
- **GUI Backend**: Rust (Tauri for security and performance)
- **GUI Frontend**: Svelte (simple, fast, beautiful)
- **Plugins**: Python (easy to write and test)

### Local AI Models
- **NLP**: Custom patterns + small BERT model
- **VLM**: LLaVA 7B or similar (runs on most hardware)
- **Fallback**: Pattern matching if models unavailable

### Data Storage
- **Config**: YAML files in ~/.config/luminous/
- **Cache**: SQLite for package info
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logs
- **Screenshots**: NEVER stored (processed in-memory only)
