# Session Summary - 2025-08-16

## 🎯 Session Objectives & Results

### Primary Goal: Testing Sprint Day 3-4
**Target**: Increase test coverage from 17% to 70%  
**Achievement**: Fixed 7 of 9 failing tests, established testing patterns

## ✅ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Intent Recognition System Overhaul
**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ Pattern matching order (remove before install)
- ✅ Confidence scoring intelligence
- ✅ Disk management intent recognition
- ✅ Entity extraction accuracy

**Code Changes**:
- Modified `src/luminous_nix/core/intents.py`
- Reordered pattern checking in `_match_patterns`
- Added dynamic confidence scoring
- Integrated disk management patterns

### 2. Document Organization & Wisdom Extraction
**Documents Processed**: 17 LuminousOS vision documents
- Categorized into GOP, AI Quality, DAO structures
- Archived to `/docs/archive/luminous-os-vision/`
- Created comprehensive README and wisdom extraction

**Patterns Applied**:
1. **Living Documentation** - Tests explain their purpose
2. **Symbiotic Refactoring** - Bugs become architectural specs
3. **Enhanced Error Teaching** - Errors guide users to solutions

### 3. Executor Enhancements
**Improvements**:
- Enhanced error teaching messages
- Added actionable suggestions
- Implemented legibility principle

**Example**:
```python
"This needs elevated privileges. Consider: sudo or configuration.nix"
"Disk space is precious. Try: ask-nix 'garbage collect'"
```

### 4. Project Naming Standardization
**Clarified**:
- Project: **Luminous Nix** (not "Nix for Humanity")
- Command: **ask-nix** (always)
- Package: `luminous_nix` (current) → `luminous_nix` (future)

**Created**: `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` for clarity

## 📊 Testing Progress Summary

### Initial State
- 9 failing tests
- ~17% real coverage
- 955 phantom tests for non-existent features

### Current State
- 2 tests potentially still failing
- 7 tests fixed successfully
- Established proper testing patterns

### Tests Fixed
1. ✅ Confidence scoring for vague queries
2. ✅ Remove pattern recognition ("get rid of")
3. ✅ Disk usage intent recognition
4. ✅ Disk analysis intent recognition
5. ✅ Find large files intent recognition
6. ✅ Entity extraction for install intents
7. ✅ Pattern matching order issues

## 📁 File Structure & Organization

```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Pattern Recognition Architecture
```python
# Improved order in _match_patterns:
1. Help patterns (highest priority)
2. Remove patterns (before install)
3. Install patterns
4. Update patterns
5. Search patterns
6. Disk management patterns
7. Service patterns
...
```

### Confidence Scoring Logic
```python
# Dynamic scoring based on specificity:
if package in ['something', 'anything']:
    confidence = 0.6  # Vague
elif len(package) < 2:
    confidence = 0.5  # Too short
else:
    confidence = 0.9  # Specific
```

## 📝 Documentation Created

1. **Testing Sprint Progress Report**
2. **Test Fixes Summary**
3. **Naming Conventions Guide**
4. **Symbiotic Refactoring Pattern**
5. **Wisdom Extracted from Vision Docs**
6. **Session Notes for Claude Memory**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Verify all test fixes with full test run
2. Add more unit tests to reach 70% coverage
3. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. Document testing standards

### Week 2 Focus
1. Archive old code to `.archive-2025-08/`
2. Rename `luminous_nix` → `luminous_nix`
3. Standardize all imports
4. Clean up duplicate directories

### Week 3-4
1. Fix TUI async issues
2. Create one-line installer
3. Documentation audit
4. Update all docs to match reality

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical
