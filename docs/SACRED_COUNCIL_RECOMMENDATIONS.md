# üïâÔ∏è Sacred Council Model Recommendations
*August 2025 - Based on actual availability and your 8GB VRAM*

## ‚úÖ Models That Actually Exist & Work

### üåü THE SACRED COUNCIL - Optimized for 8GB VRAM

#### 1. **deepseek-r1:8b** (5.2GB) - The Revolutionary Mind üß†
- **Status**: Available, downloading now
- **Role**: MIND - Deep reasoning with chain-of-thought
- **Special**: Shows its reasoning process transparently
- **Use for**: Complex problem solving, debugging, mathematical proofs
- **Philosophy**: "Thinking out loud" - transparency in reasoning

#### 2. **phi4** (9.1GB) - The Powerful Synthesist üéØ
- **Status**: Available but TOO LARGE for constant use on 8GB
- **Role**: SYNTHESIS - Most capable general intelligence
- **Note**: Would need dynamic loading, swapping with other models
- **Alternative**: phi4:mini (if it exists) would be better

#### 3. **gemma3:4b** (3.3GB) - The Multimodal Heart üíñ
- **Status**: INSTALLED and working
- **Role**: HEART - Empathetic understanding WITH VISION
- **Special**: Can see and understand images!
- **Use for**: Visual tasks, emotional support, UI understanding

#### 4. **qwen3:8b** (5.2GB) - The Unified Mind üß†
- **Status**: INSTALLED and working
- **Role**: MIND/CODER - Unified logic and code generation
- **Special**: Next-gen architecture, part of Qwen3 family
- **Use for**: Code generation, configuration, complex reasoning

#### 5. **qwen3:0.6b** (522MB) - The Lightning Reflex ‚ö°
- **Status**: INSTALLED and working
- **Role**: REFLEX - Instant responses
- **Special**: Incredibly fast, always in memory
- **Use for**: Quick yes/no, immediate feedback, system commands

## üéØ My Recommendation: The Pragmatic Sacred Council

Given your 8GB VRAM and what's actually available:

### PRIMARY COUNCIL (15.4GB total - dynamic loading required)
```yaml
sacred_council:
  reflex:
    model: "qwen3:0.6b"        # 522MB - Always loaded
    role: "Instant responses"
    
  heart:
    model: "gemma3:4b"          # 3.3GB - Multimodal empathy
    role: "Visual and emotional understanding"
    
  mind:
    model: "deepseek-r1:8b"     # 5.2GB - Revolutionary reasoning
    fallback: "qwen3:8b"        # 5.2GB - When deepseek unavailable
    role: "Deep reasoning with transparency"
    
  conscience:
    model: "mistral:7b-instruct" # 4.4GB - Ethical alignment
    role: "Instruction following and safety"
```

### DYNAMIC LOADING STRATEGY
With 8GB VRAM, you can hold:
- **Always**: Reflex (0.5GB) + System overhead (1.5GB) = 2GB used
- **Available**: 6GB for dynamic models
- **Strategy**: Load Heart + Mind OR Heart + Conscience as needed

### Why NOT phi4?
- At 9.1GB, phi4 is too large to coexist with other models
- Would monopolize your entire VRAM
- Better to use deepseek-r1:8b for reasoning tasks

## üîÆ Models We're Waiting For

These don't exist in Ollama yet (August 2025):
- ‚ùå **phi4:mini** - Would be perfect at ~2-3GB
- ‚ùå **qwen3-coder** - Specialized coding variant
- ‚ùå **qwen2.5-coder** - Previous generation coder
- ‚ùå **llama3.3** - Meta's latest

## üöÄ Immediate Action Plan

1. **Download deepseek-r1:8b** (currently downloading)
   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
   ```

2. **Skip phi4** (too large for your system)

3. **Configure Sacred Council** with available models

4. **Implement Constitutional Check** system using:
   - deepseek-r1:8b for reasoning
   - gemma3:4b for human translation
   - mistral:7b-instruct for ethical review

## üí° The Sacred Wisdom

"We don't need the absolute cutting edge - we need the RIGHT edge for our hardware."

Your Sacred Council achieves the philosophical vision while respecting physical reality:
- **Transparency** through deepseek-r1's reasoning chains
- **Empathy** through gemma3's multimodal understanding
- **Speed** through qwen3's lightning reflexes
- **Ethics** through mistral's alignment

This is not compromise - this is SYNTHESIS.
