./scripts/monitor_standards.sh

# Generate metrics dashboard
python scripts/metrics_dashboard.py

# Generate weekly report
python scripts/generate_weekly_report.py
```

### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Add to crontab for weekly reports
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && python scripts/generate_weekly_report.py

# Add to CI/CD pipeline
- name: Generate Metrics Dashboard
  run: python scripts/metrics_dashboard.py
```

## 📊 Dashboard Access

### HTML Dashboard
- **Location**: `dashboard.html` in project root
- **Features**: Interactive visualizations, progress bars, color-coded status
- **Updates**: Run `python scripts/metrics_dashboard.py` to refresh

### Markdown Reports
- **Location**: `metrics/reports/` directory
- **Format**: Detailed markdown with tables and analysis
- **Frequency**: Generated weekly or on-demand

### Console Monitor
- **Command**: `./scripts/monitor_standards.sh`
- **Features**: Real-time updates, colored output, health score
- **Controls**: Press 'r' to refresh, 'q' to quit, 'd' to generate dashboard
