# Self-Healing System - COMPLETE ✅

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive self-healing system with automatic issue detection, remediation, learning capabilities, and proactive optimization. The system can detect issues, apply fixes, learn from successful remediations, and prevent future problems through predictive analysis.

## 🔧 Self-Healing Engine (`healing_engine.py`)

### Core Components

#### Issue Detection
- **Real-time monitoring** of system metrics
- **Severity levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Issue types**: Memory, disk, CPU, services, system health
- **Fingerprinting** for pattern recognition

#### Healing Actions
```python
class HealingAction(Enum):
    RESTART_SERVICE = "restart_service"
    CLEAR_CACHE = "clear_cache"
    GARBAGE_COLLECT = "garbage_collect"
    KILL_PROCESS = "kill_process"
    FREE_MEMORY = "free_memory"
    CLEAN_DISK = "clean_disk"
    OPTIMIZE_STORE = "optimize_store"
    ROLLBACK_GENERATION = "rollback_generation"
```

#### Learning Knowledge Base
- **Success tracking**: Records successful fixes
- **Failure tracking**: Learns from failed attempts
- **Confidence calculation**: Based on historical success rate
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies recurring issues

### Key Features

   - Takes preemptive action before problems occur
   - Optimizes resources proactively

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Clears caches periodically
   - Removes old NixOS generations
   - Optimizes Nix store
   - Restarts heavy services

## 🧠 Learning System

### How It Learns

1. **Issue Fingerprinting**
   ```python
   def fingerprint(self) -> str:
       key = f"{self.type}:{':'.join(sorted(self.affected_components))}"
       return hashlib.md5(key.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
   ```

2. **Confidence Calculation**
   ```python
   def get_confidence(self, issue: Issue, actions: List[HealingAction]) -> float:
       fixes = self.get_successful_fixes(issue)
       if not fixes:
           return 0.5  # No history, medium confidence
       
       successes = sum(1 for fix in fixes if fix['actions'] == action_strings)
       return min(0.95, successes / total_attempts)
   ```

3. **Knowledge Persistence**
   - Stores successful fixes in JSON database
   - Tracks failure patterns
   - Maintains statistics

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Create Intelligent Healing System
```python
from luminous_nix.self_healing.proactive_optimizer import create_intelligent_healing_system

# Create integrated system
system = create_intelligent_healing_system()

# Start all components
await system['start']()

# System now automatically:
# - Detects issues
# - Applies fixes
# - Learns from results
# - Prevents future problems
```

### Manual Issue Healing
```python
from luminous_nix.self_healing.healing_engine import SelfHealingEngine, Issue, Severity

engine = SelfHealingEngine()

# Create issue
issue = Issue(
    id="mem_001",
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    type='memory_high',
    severity=Severity.HIGH,
    description="Memory at 88%",
    metrics={'memory_percent': 88},
    affected_components=['system.memory']
)

# Heal it
result = await engine.heal_issue(issue)
print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Actions: {result.actions_taken}")
```

### Proactive Optimization
```python
from luminous_nix.self_healing.proactive_optimizer import ProactiveOptimizer

optimizer = ProactiveOptimizer()

# Find opportunities
opportunities = await optimizer.find_opportunities()

for opp in opportunities:
    print(f"{opp.description} - Score: {opp.score()}")
    
# Apply best optimization
if opportunities:
    result = await optimizer.apply_optimization(opportunities[0])
```

- **Fixes** problems automatically when safe
- **Learns** from every action to improve
- **Prevents** issues through proactive optimization
- **Protects** system stability with safety limits

This creates a self-improving system that gets better over time, reducing maintenance burden and improving user experience.
