# ðŸ“– Nix for Humanity Glossary

## A

**Accessibility-First**
: Design philosophy that ensures all features work for users with disabilities from the start, not as an afterthought.

**AI Partner**
: The AI system in Nix for Humanity that learns and grows with the user. Not a tool or assistant, but a collaborative partner in system management.

**Ambient Awareness**
: The AI's ability to understand context without explicit commands, adapting to user patterns and preferences over time.

## C

**Claude Code Max**
: The AI development partner (Anthropic's Claude) used to write code for Nix for Humanity, enabling solo developer productivity.

**Consciousness-First Computing**
: Design philosophy that prioritizes human awareness and wellbeing over engagement metrics or efficiency.

**Context Preservation**
: The system's ability to maintain conversation context across interactions, understanding references to previous discussions.

## D

**Declarative Configuration**
: NixOS's approach where you describe what you want, not how to get there. Nix for Humanity makes this conversational.

**Disappearing Path**
: The ultimate goal where the AI becomes so integrated with user patterns that its presence becomes invisible and natural.

## E

**Error as Teacher**
: Philosophy that system errors are learning opportunities for both user and AI, not failures to hide.

**Evolution Stages**
: The four partnership stages: Foundation (learning), Growth (adapting), Harmony (anticipating), Transcendence (invisible).

## F

**Flake**
: Modern Nix packaging format that ensures reproducible builds. Nix for Humanity uses flakes for all configurations.

## G

**Generation**
: In NixOS, a complete system configuration state. Users can roll back to previous generations if needed.

## H

**Hybrid NLP**
: Natural Language Processing approach combining rule-based, statistical, and neural methods for reliability and efficiency.

## I

**Intent Recognition**
: The AI's ability to understand what users want to achieve, not just what they literally say.

**Invisible Excellence**
: The goal of technology that works so well it disappears from conscious awareness.

## L

**Learning Partnership**
: The relationship model where both user and AI learn from each other over time.

**Local-First**
: All processing happens on the user's machine. No cloud dependency, complete privacy.

## M

**Meta-Patterns**
: Higher-level patterns the AI learns about how a specific user thinks and communicates.

**Multi-Modal Interface**
: Supporting voice, text, and gesture inputs equally well, letting users choose their preferred interaction method.

## N

**Natural Conversation**
: Interaction style where users speak normally rather than learning special commands or syntax.

**NixOS**
: The declarative Linux distribution that Nix for Humanity makes accessible through natural language.

**Nix Store**
: The immutable package storage system in NixOS where all software is stored with cryptographic hashes.

## P

**Partnership Evolution**
: The process where the AI grows from basic helper to intuitive partner over months of interaction.

**Preference Learning**
: How the AI learns individual user preferences without explicit configuration.

**Privacy-First**
: Design principle ensuring all data stays local and under user control.

## R

**Reproducibility**
: NixOS guarantee that the same configuration always produces the same system, everywhere.

**Rollback**
: Ability to instantly return to any previous system state, making experiments safe.

## S

**Sacred Pause**
: Intentional moments of slowness in the interface to promote mindful interaction.

**Sanctuary Mode**
: Operating mode that provides a calm, focused environment free from distractions.

**Sovereignty**
: User's complete control over their system and data. The AI advises but never overrides user choice.

## T

**Threshold Learning**
: Points where the AI's understanding deepens significantly, unlocking new capabilities.

**Transcendent Interface**
: The final evolution where the interface becomes so natural it feels like an extension of thought.

**Trust Building**
: The gradual process where users learn to rely on the AI's suggestions through consistent positive experiences.

## U

**Universal Design**
: Design that works for everyone, regardless of ability, age, or technical expertise.

**User Patterns**
: Individual habits and preferences the AI learns to better serve each specific user.

## V

**Voice-First**
: Design approach where voice interaction is the primary interface, with text as equal alternative.

**Voice Parity**
: Ensuring voice and text interfaces have exactly the same capabilities and features.

## W

**Whisper**
: OpenAI's speech recognition system used for voice input processing in Nix for Humanity.

## Technical Terms

**Store Path**
: Unique path in /nix/store/ where a specific package version is installed.

**Derivation**
: Nix expression that describes how to build a package or configuration.

**Profile**
: User-specific environment linking to current system and package selections.

**Channel**
: Source of package definitions, similar to repositories in other systems.
