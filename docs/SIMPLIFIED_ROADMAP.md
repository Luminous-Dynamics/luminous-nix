# 🚀 Luminous Nix - Simplified Roadmap

*"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*

## 📌 Current State (v2.0 - Achieved!)
- ✅ **84% code reduction** (5,768 → 658 lines)
- ✅ **1,600x performance improvement**
- ✅ **NixOS module packaging**
- ✅ **100% test coverage** on simplified system
- ✅ **Predictive maintenance** with simple ML

## 🎯 Next 7 Days (Immediate Wins)

### Day 1-2: Friction Awareness ✅
- [x] Add friction monitoring to healing engine
- [x] Track confusion signals (errors, undos, help requests)
- [ ] Add friction dashboard to CLI output

### Day 3-4: User Experience Polish
- [ ] Implement 2-minute notification batching
- [ ] Add progressive disclosure (beginner/expert modes)
- [ ] Improve error messages with teaching format

### Day 5-7: Metrics & Monitoring
- [ ] Add simple session metrics tracking
- [ ] Create minimal dashboard (text-based)
- [ ] Document friction patterns observed

## 📅 Next 30 Days (Core Features)

### Week 2: Progressive Complexity
```
Beginner Mode → Intermediate → Expert
(5 commands)  → (10 commands) → (All features)
```
- [ ] Auto-detect user expertise level
- [ ] Adapt UI complexity accordingly
- [ ] Hide advanced features from beginners

### Week 3: Educational Errors
Every error becomes a learning opportunity:
```
Error: Package not found
Why: The package name might be misspelled
Fix: Try 'ask-nix search firefox' to find similar packages
Learn: Package names in Nix are case-sensitive
```

### Week 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Cache friction scores for faster adaptation
- [ ] Optimize healing detection (target <50ms)
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint further

## 🌟 Next 90 Days (Strategic Goals)

### Month 2: Community Readiness
Based on strategic analysis recommendations:
- [ ] **Documentation Synthesis** - Single coherent knowledge base
- [ ] **Contribution Model** - Clear CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] **Philosophy Manifesto** - Formalize consciousness-first principles

### Month 3: Technical Evolution
Carefully selected from research recommendations:
- [ ] **XState for UI** - Prevent impossible states
- [ ] **Rust Service Layer** - Performance & reliability
- [ ] **Basic Affective Computing** - Keystroke/mouse patterns only

## 🔮 6-Month Vision (Phase 3)

### Advanced Features (If Validated by Users)
- **Causal Understanding** - Why things happen, not just what
- **Flow State Protection** - Never interrupt deep work
- **Declarative GUI** - Iced framework for consistency

### What We're NOT Building
❌ **Multimodal sensors** - Privacy concerns
❌ **Facial recognition** - Ethical issues
❌ **Complex ML models** - Maintenance burden
❌ **Constitutional AI** - Research-stage

## 📊 Success Metrics (Simple & Clear)

| Metric | Current | 30-Day Target | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Code Size | 658 lines | <700 lines | <800 lines |
| Performance | 1,600x faster | Maintain | Maintain |
| Friction Score | Not tracked | <0.3 | <0.2 |
| User Sessions | N/A | 100/week | 500/week |
| Error Recovery | Unknown | >70% | >85% |

## 🏆 Key Principles (Never Compromise)

1. **Simplicity First** - Every feature must justify its complexity
2. **User Agency** - Never take control from the user
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complexity reveals as mastery grows
4. **Education Over Enforcement** - Teach, don't scold
5. **Friction Awareness** - Confused users aren't wrong, UI is

## 💡 The Disappearing Path

Ultimate goal from strategic vision:
```
Stage 1: Rich Guidance → Stage 2: Adaptive Support → Stage 3: Invisible Excellence
(New users need help) → (Growing users need hints) → (Experts need nothing)
```

The system succeeds when users no longer notice it exists.

## 🚦 Decision Framework

Before adding ANY feature, ask:
1. **Does it reduce friction?** → Proceed
2. **Can existing code handle it?** → Use existing
3. **Will beginners understand it?** → Hide in expert mode
4. **Does it add >10 lines?** → Question necessity
5. **Is there platform support?** → Use platform

## 📝 Weekly Review Questions

Every Friday, ask:
- What friction did users experience?
- What can we remove/simplify?
- Are we below 700 lines still?
- Did we maintain 1,600x performance?
- What did we learn from metrics?

## 🌊 Remember

We've already achieved the hardest part:
- **84% code reduction** ✅
- **1,600x performance** ✅
- **Clean architecture** ✅

Now we refine based on real user feedback, not imagined features.

**The best code is no code.**
**The best feature is one users don't notice.**
**The best system is one that makes itself obsolete.**
