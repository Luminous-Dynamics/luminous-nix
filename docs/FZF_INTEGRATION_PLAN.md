# 🔍 FZF/Skim Integration Plan - Consciousness-First Fuzzy Finding

## 🕉️ Sacred Alignment Check

### Purpose
Reduce cognitive load when searching 80,000+ Nix packages by providing instant, intuitive fuzzy search that feels like thinking, not searching.

### Consciousness-First Principles
- **Intentionality**: User states intent, not exact package names
- **Adaptive**: Learns from selections to improve future searches
- **Well-being**: Reduces frustration and decision fatigue
- **Inclusive**: Works for Grandma Rose AND power users

## 📋 Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Core Integration (2 hours)
```python
# 1. Add skim as dependency (Rust-based, better for Nix)
poetry add python-skim

# 2. Create search adapter
class FuzzySearchAdapter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.use_skim = check_skim_available()
        self.fallback = NativeSearch()
    
    def search(self, query, packages):
        if self.use_skim:
            return self.fuzzy_search_skim(query, packages)
        return self.fallback.search(query, packages)
```

### Stage 2: CLI Integration (1 hour)
```bash
# New command structure
ask-nix search --fuzzy firefox
ask-nix search --interactive  # Opens fuzzy finder TUI

# Natural language
ask-nix "find me a photo editor"  # Automatically uses fuzzy
```

### Stage 3: TUI Integration (1 hour)
```python
# In nix_tui.py
class SearchWidget(Widget):
    def on_key(self, event):
        if event.key == "/":  # Vim-style search
            self.open_fuzzy_finder()
    
    def open_fuzzy_finder(self):
        # Launch skim with package list
        # Show preview with descriptions
        # Return selected package
```

### Stage 4: Smart Previews (30 minutes)
```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Package Search      │ Preview                  │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### User Personas Testing
1. **Grandma Rose**: "find photo editor" → Should suggest GIMP, Krita
2. **Maya (ADHD)**: Super fast, minimal keystrokes, instant results
3. **Power User**: Regex support, pipe to other commands

### Performance Metrics
- Search latency: <50ms for 80,000 packages
- Preview generation: <100ms
- Memory usage: <50MB additional

## 🔄 Graceful Degradation

```python
def get_search_backend():
    backends = [
        SkimBackend(),      # Best: Rust-based fuzzy finder
        FZFBackend(),       # Good: Original fuzzy finder
        NativeBackend(),    # Fallback: Python string matching
    ]
    
    for backend in backends:
        if backend.is_available():
            return backend
    
    return BasicSearch()  # Always works
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- 90% reduction in time to find packages
- 95% success rate on first search
- <100ms response time

### Qualitative
- "It just knows what I mean"
- "Searching feels effortless"
- "I discovered packages I didn't know existed"

## 🌟 Advanced Features (Future)

### Learning Integration
```python
# Track what users select after searching
learning_system.observe_search(
    query="photo editor",
    selected="gimp",
    confidence=0.95
)

# Boost frequently selected packages
def rank_results(results, user_history):
    for package in results:
        if package in user_history.favorites:
            package.score *= 1.2
```

### Multi-source Search
- Nix packages
- Home-manager modules
- NixOS options
- Flake templates
- Community configs

## 🚀 Implementation Order

1. **Core skim integration** (Now)
2. **CLI search command** (Next)
3. **TUI widget** (Then)
4. **Preview system** (Finally)

## 💎 Consciousness-First Innovation

### The "Thinking Search"
Instead of typing exact names, users think naturally:
- "something for photos" → GIMP, Darktable, RawTherapee
- "like vim but modern" → Neovim, Helix, Kakoune
- "make my terminal pretty" → Starship, Oh-My-Zsh, Powerlevel10k

### Sacred Pause Integration
After 5 searches without selection:
```
🧘 Taking a sacred pause...
Perhaps you're looking for something specific?
Would you like to:
- Describe what you want to accomplish?
- Browse categories instead?
- See popular packages?
```

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Fuzzy search works in TUI
- [ ] Graceful fallback when skim unavailable
- [ ] Preview shows useful information
- [ ] Performance meets targets
