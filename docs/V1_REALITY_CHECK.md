## 🎭 The Honest Truth

### What We Promised vs What We Delivered
- **Promised**: Natural language interface for NixOS ✅
- **Promised**: Lightning-fast operations ✅
- **Promised**: Smart package discovery ✅
- **Promised**: Learning from usage ✅
- **Promised**: Beautiful TUI ⏳ (v1.1)
- **Promised**: Voice interface ⏳ (v1.1)

### Why TUI/Voice Aren't in v1.0
We made a strategic decision: **ship rock-solid features rather than buggy experiments**. The TUI and Voice interfaces are built but need more testing. Rather than include half-working features, we're polishing them for v1.1.
