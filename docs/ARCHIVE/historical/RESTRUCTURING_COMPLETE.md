# ✅ Documentation Restructuring Complete

*Documentation has been reorganized for clarity and accessibility*

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Proper Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── philosophy/          ✅ Existing philosophical framework
├── guides/              ✅ Complete user-facing guides
├── technical/           ✅ Technical documentation
├── development/         ✅ Developer resources  
├── project/             ✅ Project management docs
├── stories/             📝 Ready for user contributions
└── archive/             ✅ Old/outdated documents
```

### 2. Created Missing Priority Documents

**User Guides** (✅ Complete):
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user manual
- `PARTNERSHIP_GUIDE.md` - Guide to AI partnership
- `FAQ.md` - Frequently asked questions

**Development** (✅ Complete):
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Complete developer guide

**Technical** (✅ Sample):
- `LEARNING_SYSTEM.md` - How the AI learns

**Examples** (✅ Created):
- `examples/basic-usage/` - Common usage patterns

### 3. Cleaned Root Directory

Moved to appropriate locations:
- Project docs → `docs/project/`
- Technical docs → `docs/technical/`
- Old visions → `docs/archive/old-visions/`
- Scripts → `scripts/`
- Cleanup plans → `docs/archive/`

### 4. Consolidated Duplicates

- Merged `docs/docs/` into `docs/`
- Removed redundant structures
- Unified documentation paths

## Current Status

### Documentation Completeness
| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Philosophy | ✅ Complete | All 5 documents present |
| User Guides | ✅ Complete | All priority guides created |
| Technical | 🟡 Partial | Core docs present, more needed |
| Development | ✅ Complete | Main guide created |
| Stories | 🔴 Empty | Awaiting user contributions |

### Root Directory
Now contains only:
- Essential config files (`.nix`, `.json`, `.yml`)
- README and core docs (README, QUICKSTART, etc.)
- Source directories (`src/`, `implementations/`)
- Scripts directory
- Build/dev files

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Organization** - Easy to find any document
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth
3. **Logical Grouping** - Related docs together
4. **Clean Root** - Only essential files remain
5. **Better Navigation** - Clear paths through documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Fill Technical Docs** - Add remaining technical documentation
2. **Gather Stories** - Collect user experiences
3. **Update References** - Ensure all links work
4. **Maintain Structure** - Keep organization as project grows

## For Future Reference

When adding new documentation:
- User-facing → `docs/guides/`
- Technical details → `docs/technical/`
- Dev resources → `docs/development/`
- Project updates → `docs/project/`
- Old/outdated → `docs/archive/`

Never put documentation in root unless it's:
- README.md
- QUICKSTART.md
- LICENSE
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CHANGELOG.md
