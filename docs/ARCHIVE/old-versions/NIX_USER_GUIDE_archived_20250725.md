## How to Talk to Your Computer

Nix for Humanity lets you control NixOS using natural language. Just say what you want!

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup
When you first start Nix for Humanity:

```
System: "Hi! I'm Nix for Humanity. I'll help you manage your computer using natural conversation. What would you like to do?"

You: "Hi! Can you help me install a web browser?"

System: "Of course! I can install Firefox, Chrome, or Brave. Which would you prefer?"

You: "Firefox please"

System: "Installing Firefox web browser... Done! You'll find it in your applications menu. Would you like me to open it now?"
```

## Common Tasks

### Installing Software

**Natural ways to ask:**
- "Install Firefox"
- "I need a photo editor"
- "Can you get me that video player everyone uses?"
- "Add the thing for PDFs"

**Example conversations:**

```
You: "I need something to edit photos"
System: "I can suggest a few photo editors:
- GIMP (full-featured, like Photoshop)
- Krita (great for digital art)
- Inkscape (for vector graphics)
Which sounds good for your needs?"

You: "The first one"
System: "Installing GIMP... Done! GIMP is now available in your applications menu under Graphics."
```

### Fixing Problems

**Natural ways to ask:**
- "My WiFi isn't working"
- "The internet is broken"
- "Everything is really slow"
- "I can't print"

**Example conversations:**

```
You: "My WiFi stopped working"
System: "I'll help you fix that. Let me check your WiFi... I see your WiFi adapter is disabled. Would you like me to enable it?"

You: "Yes please"
System: "Enabling WiFi adapter... Done! I can see 3 networks available. Would you like to connect to one?"
```

### System Maintenance

**Natural ways to ask:**
- "Clean up my computer"
- "Free up some space"
- "Update everything"
- "Is my system healthy?"

**Example conversations:**

```
You: "My computer feels full"
System: "Let me check your disk space... You're using 89% of your disk. I found:
- 12GB of old system generations
- 5GB of package cache
- 3GB of log files
Would you like me to clean these up?"

You: "Yes, but keep one old generation just in case"
System: "Keeping the most recent generation and cleaning up the rest... Freed 18GB! Your disk is now at 71% usage."
```

### Getting Information

**Natural ways to ask:**
- "What's my IP address?"
- "How much RAM do I have?"
- "What version of Linux am I running?"
- "Show me what's using my CPU"

**Example conversations:**

```
You: "What's taking up all my memory?"
System: "Here are your top memory users:
1. Firefox - 2.3GB (45%)
2. VS Code - 1.1GB (22%)
3. Slack - 0.8GB (16%)

You have 5.1GB total, with 0.8GB free. Would you like tips on reducing memory usage?"
```

## Understanding Responses

### Confirmation Before Action
Nix for Humanity always confirms before making changes:

```
You: "Remove Firefox"
System: "I'll remove Firefox web browser. This will also remove your bookmarks and settings. Are you sure?"
You: "Actually, no"
System: "No problem! Firefox remains installed."
```

### Learning From You
The system learns your preferences:

```
You: "Install my usual tools"
System: "Based on your history, I'll install:
- VS Code (your preferred editor)
- Firefox (your usual browser)
- Git (you use this often)
Is this correct?"
```

### Clear Error Messages
When something goes wrong:

```
You: "Install photoshop"
System: "Photoshop isn't available for Linux, but I can suggest alternatives:
- GIMP (free, very powerful)
- Krita (great for digital art)
- You could also run Photoshop in a Windows VM
What would work best for you?"
```

## Voice Commands

### Wake Words
- "Hey Nix"
- "Nix, please"
- "Computer" (if enabled)

### Voice Interaction Tips
1. **Speak naturally** - No need for robot talk
2. **Pause after wake word** - Wait for the listening tone
3. **Be conversational** - "Can you help me..." works great
4. **Corrections work** - "No, I meant Firefox, not Chrome"

### Example Voice Session
```
You: "Hey Nix"
*listening tone*
You: "My screen is too bright"
System: "I'll help adjust that. Your brightness is at 100%. Would you like me to set it to 70%?"
You: "Make it 50"
System: "Setting brightness to 50%... Done. Is that better?"
```
