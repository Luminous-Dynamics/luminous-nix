# üéØ Nix for Humanity Development Roadmap

## Vision
Making NixOS accessible through natural language - use your own words, not computer commands. Type it or speak it, the choice is yours.

## Core Philosophy
- **Natural Language First**: Understand what users mean, not syntax
- **Equal Input Methods**: Typing and speaking are both first-class
- **Optional Enhancements**: Visual feedback, audio responses when helpful
- **$200/Month Revolution**: One developer + Claude Code Max
- **Ship Weekly**: Small, focused releases every week
