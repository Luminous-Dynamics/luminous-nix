# 🚀 Luminous Nix - Improvement Roadmap

## 🎯 Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)
*High impact, low effort - DO IMMEDIATELY after v1.0.0 release*

#### 1.1 Testing Coverage (85% → 95%)
```bash
# Current gaps that need immediate attention:
- Voice interface error handling
- Plugin sandbox escape attempts
- TUI keyboard shortcuts
- Async timeout scenarios
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add 50 edge case tests
- [ ] Add security penetration tests
- [ ] Add integration test suite
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

**Implementation:**
```python
# tests/test_edge_cases.py
class TestEdgeCases:
    def test_voice_without_microphone(self):
        """Graceful fallback when no audio device"""

    def test_plugin_malicious_code(self):
        """Verify sandbox prevents harmful operations"""

    def test_tui_unicode_handling(self):
        """Handle emoji and special characters"""
```

#### 1.2 Real NixOS Integration
```python
# Current: subprocess calls
# Improvement: Direct Nix store interaction

class NixStoreInterface:
    """Direct interface to Nix store without subprocess"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.store_path = Path("/nix/store")
        self.db = sqlite3.connect("/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite")

    def query_package(self, name: str) -> Optional[Package]:
        """Query directly from Nix database"""
        # 100x faster than subprocess
```

#### 1.2 Error Message Quality
- [ ] Add error codes for every error type
- [ ] Add solution suggestions for common errors
- [ ] Add links to documentation
- [ ] Add recovery commands

### Priority 2: User Experience (Week 3-4)
*High impact, medium effort - Critical for adoption*

#### 2.1 Offline Voice Recognition
```python
# Add Vosk for offline speech recognition
class OfflineVoiceInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        # Download small model (50MB)
        self.model = vosk.Model("vosk-model-small-en-us")

    def recognize_offline(self, audio) -> str:
        """Works without internet connection"""
```

#### 2.2 Smart Command Suggestions
```python
class SmartSuggestions:
    """Anticipate user needs based on context"""

    def suggest_next(self, history: List[Command]) -> List[str]:
        # If user installed postgres, suggest:
        # - "create postgres database"
        # - "enable postgres service"
        # - "install pgadmin"
```

#### 2.3 Progress Persistence
```python
class ProgressTracker:
    """Save progress for long operations"""

    def checkpoint(self, operation: str, progress: float):
        # If system update interrupted at 60%
        # Can resume from that point
```

### Priority 3: Performance Optimization (Month 2)
*Medium impact, medium effort*

#### 3.1 Lazy Loading Everything
```python
# Current: Import everything at startup
# Better: Import only when needed

class LazyLoader:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name == "voice":
            from .voice import VoiceInterface
            self.voice = VoiceInterface
            return self.voice
```

#### 3.2 Caching Layer Enhancement
```python
class SmartCache:
    """Multi-level caching with TTL"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_cache = {}  # Instant
        self.disk_cache = {}    # Fast
        self.network_cache = {} # Fallback
```

#### 3.3 Parallel Command Execution
```python
async def execute_batch(commands: List[str]):
    """Execute independent commands in parallel"""
    # "install firefox, vscode, and git"
    # Runs all three simultaneously
```

### Priority 4: Intelligence Features (Month 3)
*High impact, high effort*

#### 4.1 Local LLM Integration
```bash
# Use Ollama for enhanced understanding
./bin/ask-nix "set up a development environment for my React project"
# LLM understands: nodejs, npm, vscode, prettier, eslint, etc.
```

#### 4.2 Pattern Learning
```python
class PatternLearner:
    """Learn from user behavior"""

    def detect_workflow(self, commands: List[Command]) -> Workflow:
        # User always: update → backup → restart
        # Suggest: "Would you like to create an alias?"
```

#### 4.3 Predictive Assistance
```python
class PredictiveAssistant:
    """Anticipate issues before they happen"""

    def analyze_system(self) -> List[Warning]:
        # "Your disk is 90% full, updates might fail"
        # "Package X conflicts with Y you're about to install"
```
