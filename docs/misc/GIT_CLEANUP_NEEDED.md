## ðŸ“‹ Still Uncommitted (~500 files)

### High Priority for Review:
1. **Documentation reorganization** in `docs/`
2. **Development/build files** (.gitignore updates, config files)
3. **Backend implementation** in `backend/` (appears to be symlink)
4. **Frontend/implementations** directories

### Should Probably Add to .gitignore:
- `*.db` files (databases)
- `coverage.xml`
- `poetry.lock` (or commit if intentional)
- `__pycache__/`
- `.coverage`
- `test_results.txt`

### Documentation Cleanup Needed:
- Massive deletion of old docs structure
- New docs structure in numbered folders (01-VISION, 02-ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- Many duplicate/obsolete docs

### TypeScript Cleanup:
- Old implementations in `implementations/web-based/`
- Build artifacts in `dist-cjs/`
- TypeScript source files (`.ts`) being deleted

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Actions:

1. **Update .gitignore** for common patterns:
   ```bash
   *.db
   *.pyc
   __pycache__/
   .coverage
   coverage.xml
   poetry.lock
   test_results.txt
   dist/
   build/
   *.egg-info/
   ```

2. **Commit new implementation** in logical chunks:
   - Python backend structure
   - Test suite
   - Scripts and utilities
   - Documentation reorganization

3. **Clean up TypeScript**:
   - Remove build artifacts
   - Archive or delete old implementations
   - Keep only necessary NLP engine

4. **Review and commit**:
   - Important configuration files
   - Development tools
   - New features

## ðŸš¨ Important Files to Review:
- `pyproject.toml` - New Python package configuration
- `STATUS.md` - Project status document
- `backend/` - Entire backend implementation
- `src/nix_for_humanity/` - Core Python implementation

## Next Steps:
1. Review `pyproject.toml` and decide if Poetry migration is intended
2. Commit core Python implementation
3. Clean up TypeScript artifacts
4. Organize scripts into keep/archive/delete
5. Commit new documentation structure
