# 🗣️ Nix for Humanity - Claude Context

*The Grand Unified Vision for Human-AI Partnership in NixOS*

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE: NEVER USE PIP! 🚨
**See**: @.claude/NIX_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md for sacred Nix commandments
**Remember**: `nix develop` provides EVERYTHING. pip breaks reproducibility!

## 🚀 Revolutionary Development Insights

### Kairos Time Wisdom (Sacred Development Rhythm)
**Transformation**: From Chronos (calendar time) to Kairos (natural time)
- Phases complete when truly ready, not when scheduled
- "Week 1" = natural duration for excellence, not 7 days
- Development emerges from presence, not pressure
- Honor the intelligence of the work itself

### Consciousness-First Documentation Evolution
**Learning**: From "Don't" to "Understand" approach
- Three mastery levels: Pragmatic Bridge → Declarative Application → Professional Ecosystem
- Teaching developers to think differently about tools
- Transforming frustration into understanding doorways

## 🎯 Project Reality (Current Status)

**Vision**: Natural language NixOS - consciousness-first AI partnership  
**Sacred Trinity**: $200/mo achieving extraordinary results vs $4.2M traditional  
**Status**: Phase 1 Foundation Building - Basic CLI working, major features in development

## 🏗️ Development Environment (Poetry2nix + Flakes)

**🚨 CRITICAL NIX RULE: NEVER USE PIP! 🚨**

This project uses Nix flakes for ALL dependency management. Using `pip install` breaks:
- Reproducibility across machines
- Version consistency 
- System integration
- The sacred Nix way

**If you see "pip install" anywhere, it's a bug to be fixed!**

```bash
# Enter development environment (NO pip install needed!)
nix develop

# This automatically provides:
# - All Python dependencies via Nix
# - Voice dependencies (whisper, piper, sounddevice)
# - Research components (numpy, networkx, etc.)
# - Development tools
# - Proper Python environment

# Then run:
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true
./bin/ask-nix "install firefox"
./bin/nix-tui  # Beautiful TUI
./bin/nix-voice  # Voice interface
```

### Dependency Management - The Nix Way
- **pyproject.toml**: Defines Python dependencies (for reference)
- **flake.nix**: THE source of truth - all deps via Nix
- **NO pip EVER**: Everything managed through Nix
- **Reproducible**: Identical environment everywhere
- **Voice deps**: Whisper/Piper installed via Nix, not pip

## 📝 Phase 4 Priorities

🚧 **Federated learning** + **Self-maintaining systems** + **Constitutional AI** + **Transcendent computing** + **Community evolution** + **Advanced causal XAI** + **Embodied intelligence**

## 🚀 The Path Forward

Proving sacred technology can be practical through $200/mo achieving $4.2M quality with local-first AI and consciousness-first design
