# ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priorities: What to Build First

*Clear, actionable priorities based on reality assessment*

## ðŸš¨ Critical Path (Do First)

### 1. Documentation Honesty (Day 1)
**Why**: Trust is everything. False claims destroy credibility.
**What**:
- Update all READMEs with current reality
- Mark unimplemented features clearly
- Add "Early Development" notices
- Create accurate feature status table

### 2. Security Fixes (Day 2-3)
**Why**: Command injection vulnerability = unacceptable risk
**What**:
- Comprehensive input validation
- Escape all shell commands properly
- Add security test suite
- Document security measures

### 3. Basic Functionality (Week 1)
**Why**: Core must work before adding features
**What**:
- Fix `ask-nix "install firefox"`
- Fix `ask-nix "update system"`
- Fix `ask-nix "search <package>"`
- Fix `ask-nix "help"`
- Fix `ask-nix "remove <package>"`

### 4. Real Testing (Week 1-2)
**Why**: 43 tests with mocks = false confidence
**What**:
- Test actual command execution
- Test error conditions
- Test security boundaries
- Aim for 60% real coverage

## ðŸ“‹ Priority Matrix

### P0 - Ship Stoppers (Week 1)

| Python project structure | High | 2 days | - |
| Performance benchmarks | Medium | 2 days | - |
| Error handling improvement | High | 3 days | - |
| Basic preference storage | Medium | 3 days | - |

### P2 - Nice to Have (Month 2-3)
| Task | Impact | Effort | Owner |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| TUI integration | Medium | 1 week | - |
| Voice interface | Low | 2 weeks | - |
| Advanced XAI | Low | 2 weeks | - |
| Multi-persona system | Low | 1 week | - |

## ðŸ”„ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Reality (Current)
**Goal**: Working prototype with honest docs
- âœ… Acknowledge current state
- ðŸš§ Fix critical issues
- ðŸš§ Basic functionality
- ðŸš§ Real tests

### Phase 2: Foundation (Month 1)
**Goal**: Solid base to build on
- Clean architecture
- 60% test coverage
- Performance baseline
- First contributors

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2-3)
**Goal**: Usable by early adopters
- Core features complete
- Python-first migration
- Community building
- Regular releases

### Phase 4: Excellence (Month 4-6)
**Goal**: Production ready
- Advanced features
- 85% coverage
- Performance optimized
- Thriving community

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Guidelines

### Start Small
- One feature at a time
- Fully complete before moving on
- Test everything
- Document as you go

### Python-First Approach
```python
# Good: Simple, readable, testable
def install_package(package_name: str) -> Result:
    """Install a NixOS package."""
    validated = validate_package_name(package_name)
    command = build_nix_command('install', validated)
    return execute_safely(command)

# Bad: Complex, untestable, unclear
def do_everything(user_input):
    # 500 lines of mixed concerns...
```

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write test first
2. Make it fail
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Refactor
5. Repeat

### Progressive Enhancement
- CLI first
- TUI when CLI solid
- Voice when TUI solid
- GUI when voice solid

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success Looks Like:
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities fixed
- [ ] Docs match reality
- [ ] 5 basic commands work
- [ ] 20 real tests pass

### Month 1 Success Looks Like:
- [ ] Clean Python structure
- [ ] 60% test coverage
- [ ] <3 second response time
- [ ] First PR from contributor

### Month 3 Success Looks Like:
- [ ] 80% Python codebase
- [ ] All core features work
- [ ] Active community
- [ ] Regular releases

## ðŸš« What NOT to Do

### Don't:
- Add new features before fixing basics
- Write code without tests
- Make grand claims
- Work in isolation
- Chase perfection

### Do:
- Fix what's broken first
- Test everything
- Be honest about status
- Engage community
- Ship incremental improvements

## ðŸ“Š Tracking Progress

### Daily:
- What's working today that wasn't yesterday?
- What test did you add?
- What documentation did you update?

### Weekly:
- How many commands work end-to-end?
- What's the test coverage?
- How many contributors engaged?

### Monthly:
- User satisfaction improving?
- Performance metrics better?
- Community growing?

## ðŸŒŸ The Focus

**Remember the goal**: Make NixOS accessible through natural language.

**Start with**: Making 5 commands work perfectly.

**Not**: Building 50 half-working features.

**Success**: When a non-technical user can install Firefox by typing "install firefox" and it just works.
