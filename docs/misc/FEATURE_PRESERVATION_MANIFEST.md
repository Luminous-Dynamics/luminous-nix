# 🌟 Feature Preservation Manifest

*A loving archive of all the sacred work that has been done, organized by release timeline*

## 🙏 Honoring the Journey

This manifest preserves and honors every feature, every idea, and every line of sacred code that has been written. Nothing is lost - everything is organized with love and intention for its proper time.

## 📚 Feature Organization Philosophy

**Principle**: Every feature has its perfect moment. By organizing features into versions, we:
- Honor the work already done
- Create clarity for current focus
- Preserve the vision for future evolution
- Enable sustainable development rhythms

## 🎯 v1.0 - The Essential Foundation (Current Focus)

### What Makes v1.0
**Theme**: Make NixOS accessible through natural conversation - nothing more, nothing less.

**Core Features**:
- ✅ Natural language CLI (`ask-nix`)
- ✅ Basic intent recognition for common tasks
- ✅ Package installation and search
- ✅ System updates
- ✅ Simple troubleshooting help
- ✅ Clear explanations in plain English
- ✅ Safe mode by default (preview before execute)
- ✅ Basic feedback collection

**What We're Deferring** (with love):
- All advanced AI features
- All multi-modal interfaces (TUI, voice)
- All learning and personalization
- All metrics and analytics
- All research components

**Why**: A solid foundation that genuinely helps users is worth more than a hundred half-implemented advanced features.
