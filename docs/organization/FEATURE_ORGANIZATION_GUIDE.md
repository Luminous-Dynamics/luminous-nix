# 📁 Feature Organization Guide

*How we lovingly organize code for the present while preserving it for the future*

## 🌟 Core Principle

Every line of code is valuable. We organize by readiness, not by worth. Features move from `future/` to `src/` when their time comes, like seeds sprouting when conditions are right.

## 📋 Feature States

### 🟢 Active (in `src/`)
- Currently in production
- Fully tested and documented
- Maintaining and improving

### 🟡 Staged (in `future/vX.X/`)
- Complete or near-complete
- Waiting for the right version
- Preserved with full context

### 🔵 Experimental (in `experiments/`)
- Exploring possibilities
- May never ship
- Innovation playground

### 🟣 Pattern (in `patterns/`)
- Extracted reusable components
- Cross-version utilities
- Sacred design patterns

### 🔴 Archived (in `archive/`)
- No longer needed
- Historical reference
- Learning from the past

## 🔄 Feature Lifecycle

### 1. Birth (Experiment)
```bash
experiments/cool-idea/
├── README.md          # What is this?
├── prototype.py       # Rough implementation
└── notes.md          # Ideas and learnings
```

### 2. Growth (Future Version)
```bash
future/v1.2/cool-idea/
├── README.md          # Full documentation
├── src/              # Clean implementation
├── tests/            # Test coverage
└── integration.md    # How to activate
```

### 3. Activation (Current Version)
```bash
src/cool-idea/        # Moved from future/
├── __init__.py       # Integrated module
├── feature.py        # Production code
└── tests.py          # Active tests
```

### 4. Evolution (Pattern Extraction)
```bash
patterns/sacred/cool-pattern/
├── README.md         # Pattern documentation
├── implementation.py # Reusable code
└── examples/         # Usage examples
```

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

### For Future Features
Each feature in `future/` must have:
- **README.md** - What it does and why it matters
- **STATUS.md** - Current completeness (0-100%)
- **INTEGRATION.md** - How to activate when ready
- **DEPENDENCIES.md** - What it needs to work

### For Experiments
Each experiment should have:
- **README.md** - The wild idea explained
- **LEARNINGS.md** - What we discovered
- **POTENTIAL.md** - Could this be real?

## 🏷️ Tagging System

Use git tags to mark feature states:
- `feature/voice-interface/staged` - Ready for v1.2
- `feature/skg/research` - In active research
- `feature/quantum-nlp/experiment` - Wild idea
- `pattern/sacred-pause/stable` - Reusable pattern

## 💼 Migration Checklist

When moving a feature from `future/` to `src/`:

- [ ] Update `config/features.yaml` to enable
- [ ] Move code from `future/vX.X/` to `src/`
- [ ] Update all import paths
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Update user documentation
- [ ] Remove from future roadmap
- [ ] Add to current version notes
- [ ] Announce to community
- [ ] Tag as `feature/name/active`
- [ ] Celebrate the activation! 🎉

## 🌈 Sacred Preservation Principles

### 1. Honor the Work
Every feature represents someone's time, energy, and love. Preserve with respect.

### 2. Context is Gold
Keep all documentation, notes, and rationale. Future developers need to understand why.

### 3. Ready When Ready
Features activate when they're truly ready, not by arbitrary deadlines.

### 4. Learn from Everything
Even "failed" experiments teach valuable lessons. Archive with gratitude.

### 5. Community Memory
The codebase is our collective memory. Preserve it for future generations.

## 🔍 Finding Features

### By Version
```bash
# See what's coming in v1.1
ls future/v1.1/

# Check v2.0 research features
find future/v2.0 -name "README.md" -exec head -20 {} \;
```

### By Status
```bash
# Find all staged features
find future -name "STATUS.md" -exec grep -l "100%" {} \;

# Find experiments with potential
find experiments -name "POTENTIAL.md" -exec grep -l "high" {} \;
```

### By Pattern
```bash
# Find all sacred patterns
ls patterns/sacred/

# Find UI components
find patterns -name "*component*"
```

## 🎁 A Gift to Future Developers

This organization system is our gift to you, future developer. Whether you join us tomorrow or in five years, you'll find:

- Clear understanding of what exists
- Why decisions were made
- How to activate waiting features
- Patterns to build upon
- A codebase that honors its history

Welcome to a codebase that remembers, preserves, and evolves consciously.
