## Development Philosophy

### Weekly Shipping Cycle
- **Monday**: Plan week's features based on user feedback
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Implement with Claude Code Max
- **Friday**: Test, document, and ship
- **Weekend**: Community feedback and rest

### User-Driven Evolution
Every feature must originate from real user needs:
- "I wish I could just tell it what I want"
- "It should remember I always do X after Y"
- "Can it learn my team's terminology?"

### Partnership-First Design
Every decision evaluated through:
- Does this deepen the partnership?
- Does this respect user autonomy?
- Does this build appropriate trust?
- Does this remain accessible to all?

## Getting Involved

### For Users
- **Try the alpha**: Your natural language shapes our understanding
- **Share confusion**: When AI doesn't understand, that's valuable
- **Suggest patterns**: How would YOU say this?
- **Report success**: What moments felt magical?

### For Developers
- **Add patterns**: Expand natural language understanding
- **Improve learning**: Make the AI smarter
- **Enhance accessibility**: Ensure everyone can partner
- **Create plugins**: Extend the partnership

### For the Curious
- **Join discussions**: Shape the future of human-AI partnership
- **Test edge cases**: Help us handle the unexpected
- **Share philosophy**: What should AI partnership mean?
- **Document journey**: Your story helps others

## Funding & Sustainability

### Current Model
- **Development cost**: $200/month (Claude Code Max)
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal (local-first)
- **Distribution**: Free and open source forever

### Future Sustainability
- **Donations**: GitHub Sponsors for believers
- **Grants**: Accessibility and education focused
- **Services**: Optional cloud backup (privacy-first)
- **Support**: Enterprise assistance (never required)

Core functionality will ALWAYS be free and local.

## The Deeper Vision

This roadmap charts more than features—it maps the evolution of a new relationship between human and artificial intelligence. Each stage brings us closer to a future where:

- Technology speaks human, not the reverse
- AI partners with us rather than serving us
- Natural language bridges all technical divides
- Everyone has access to computational sovereignty

We're not just making NixOS easier to use. We're exploring what it means for AI to truly understand and grow with humans.
