# 🎭 Personality Styles - Adaptive Communication System

## Adaptive Learning System

### How It Learns Your Style

1. **Initial Interactions**
   - Starts with Friendly Assistant as default
   - Observes your language patterns
   - Notes your reaction to different styles

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   ```javascript
   // Example learning patterns
   if (userUsesShortCommands && noSmallTalk) {
     suggestStyle('minimal');
   }
   
   if (userAsksQuestions && thanksOften) {
     suggestStyle('encouraging');
   }
   
   if (userUsesEmoji || makesJokes) {
     suggestStyle('playful');
   }
   ```

3. **Explicit Preference Setting**
   ```
   User: be more technical
   System: Switching to minimal technical style.
   
   User: can you be friendlier?
   System: Of course! I'll be warmer and more conversational.
   
   User: talk normal please
   System: I'll use a friendly, professional tone.
   ```

### Style Switching

Users can switch styles anytime:
- "be brief" → Minimal
- "be friendly" → Friendly
- "encourage me" → Encouraging  
- "make it fun" → Playful
- "sacred mode" → Sacred

### Context-Aware Adaptation

The system adjusts style based on context:

**During Errors** - All styles become more patient:
- Minimal: "Error: File not found. Check path."
- Friendly: "I couldn't find that file. Let's check the path."
- Encouraging: "No worries! File not found - happens to everyone. Let's look together."

**During Learning** - All styles become more educational:
- Minimal: "New command: nix-shell. Enters development environment."
- Friendly: "Here's something new: nix-shell helps you enter a development environment."
- Encouraging: "You're learning something powerful! nix-shell creates a special development space."

## Implementation Details

### Style Configuration

```typescript
interface PersonalityStyle {
  name: string;
  formality: 0-1;        // 0 = casual, 1 = formal
  verbosity: 0-1;        // 0 = minimal, 1 = detailed  
  emotionality: 0-1;     // 0 = neutral, 1 = expressive
  encouragement: 0-1;    // 0 = matter-of-fact, 1 = supportive
  playfulness: 0-1;      // 0 = serious, 1 = playful
  spirituality: 0-1;     // 0 = secular, 1 = sacred
}

const styles = {
  minimal: {
    formality: 0.8,
    verbosity: 0.1,
    emotionality: 0.1,
    encouragement: 0.1,
    playfulness: 0.0,
    spirituality: 0.0
  },
  // ... other styles
};
```

### Response Generation

function generateResponse(intent: Intent, style: PersonalityStyle): string {
  const baseResponse = getBaseResponse(intent);
  
  return applyStyle(baseResponse, {
    addExplanation: style.verbosity > 0.5,
    addEmoji: style.playfulness > 0.7,
    addEncouragement: style.encouragement > 0.6,
    addMantra: style.spirituality > 0.8,
