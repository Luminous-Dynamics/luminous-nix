# 🛡️ Security & Privacy in Partnership - Nix for Humanity

## Our Security Commitment

In the Nix for Humanity partnership, security isn't just about protecting systems—it's about protecting the sacred trust between human and AI. Every security decision reflects our commitment to user sovereignty, privacy, and transparent partnership.

## 🔐 Security Philosophy: Trust Through Transparency

### Core Principles
1. **Privacy is Sacred** - What you share with your AI partner stays with you
2. **Transparency Builds Trust** - You can see exactly what the AI does and knows
3. **Local-First Always** - Your data never leaves your machine without explicit consent
4. **User Sovereignty** - You control what the AI learns and remembers
5. **Safe by Default** - Security isn't optional, it's foundational

### Local-First Processing

**Everything happens on YOUR machine:**
- Voice recognition (Whisper.cpp)
- Natural language understanding
- Pattern learning and adaptation
- Command generation
- Preference storage

**Nothing goes to the cloud unless you explicitly choose:**
- Optional community pattern sharing (anonymized)
- Optional backup services (encrypted)
- Optional cloud AI enhancement (with consent)

## 🎯 Threat Model & Protection

### What We Protect Against

#### 1. Command Injection Through Natural Language
**Threat**: Malicious input trying to execute harmful commands
**Protection**: 
```typescript
// Multi-layer validation
const validateIntent = async (input: string): Promise<SafeIntent> => {
  // Layer 1: Input sanitization
  const sanitized = sanitizeNaturalLanguage(input);
  
  // Layer 2: Intent classification with safety scoring
  const intent = await classifyIntent(sanitized);
  if (intent.safetyScore < SAFETY_THRESHOLD) {
    return { rejected: true, reason: 'Potentially unsafe intent' };
  }
  
  // Layer 3: Command validation
  const command = buildCommand(intent);
  const validation = await validateCommand(command);
  
  // Layer 4: User confirmation for system changes
  if (validation.requiresConfirmation) {
    const confirmed = await partnership.getConfirmation(command);
    if (!confirmed) return { rejected: true, reason: 'User declined' };
  }
  
  return { safe: true, intent, command };
};
```

#### 2. Privacy Leakage Through AI Learning
**Threat**: AI accidentally revealing private information
**Protection**:
- Segmented learning memory
- No cross-user data sharing
- Explicit boundaries for what AI can learn
- Regular memory audits available to user

#### 3. Unauthorized System Access
**Threat**: Escalation beyond user permissions
**Protection**:
- Polkit integration for privileged operations
- Capability-based permissions
- Audit trail of all system modifications
- Rollback capability for all changes

#### 4. Voice Impersonation
**Threat**: Someone else using voice commands
**Protection**:
- Optional voice biometrics
- Confirmation for sensitive operations
- Visual confirmation always available
- Text password fallback

### What's Out of Scope
- Physical access attacks (trust your environment)
- Nation-state adversaries (beyond our threat model)
- Hardware-level vulnerabilities
- Supply chain attacks on NixOS itself

## 🔒 Privacy Protection Features

### Your AI Partner's Memory

**What the AI Remembers (with your permission):**
```yaml
User Patterns:
  - Preferred command phrases
  - Common workflows
  - Timing preferences
  - Error recovery patterns
  
Never Stored:
  - Passwords or secrets
  - Personal conversations
  - Sensitive file contents
  - System credentials
```

**Memory Management Commands:**
```
"Show me what you've learned about me"
"Forget everything from today"
"Reset your memory completely"
"Export what you know about me"
"Pause learning mode"
```

### Data Control Dashboard

Access your privacy dashboard through:
```
"Show me my privacy settings"
"What data are you storing?"
"Delete my learning history"
"Show me the audit log"
```

### Anonymization for Community Learning

If you choose to help improve community patterns:
```typescript
const anonymizePattern = (pattern: UserPattern): CommunityPattern => {
  return {
    // What we share
    intentType: pattern.intent,
    successRate: pattern.success,
    commonVariations: generalizeVariations(pattern.phrases),
    
    // What we never share
    // ❌ username
    // ❌ file paths
    // ❌ personal vocabulary
    // ❌ timing data
    // ❌ system configuration
  };
};
```

## 🛡️ Security Features in Action

### Safe Command Execution

Every command goes through safety layers:

```typescript
// Example: User says "delete everything in my downloads"
async function executeUserIntent(naturalLanguage: string) {
  // 1. Understanding with safety awareness
  const intent = await understandIntent(naturalLanguage);
  // Result: { action: "delete", target: "~/Downloads/*", risk: "high" }
  
  // 2. Risk assessment
  const risk = await assessRisk(intent);
  if (risk.level === 'high') {
    // 3. Enhanced confirmation for risky operations
    const details = await explainConsequences(intent);
    const confirmed = await getInformedConsent(details);
    
    if (!confirmed) {
      return { 
        executed: false, 
        reason: "User reconsidered after understanding consequences" 
      };
    }
  }
  
  // 4. Sandboxed execution with rollback capability
  const execution = await sandbox.execute(intent, {
    rollbackEnabled: true,
    auditLog: true
  });
  
  // 5. Learn from outcome
  await partnership.learn({
    intent,
    outcome: execution,
    userSatisfaction: await getUserFeedback()
  });
  
  return execution;
}
```

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// Flexible authentication respecting user preferences
interface AuthenticationOptions {
  text: boolean;      // Always available
  voice: boolean;     // If user enabled
  biometric: boolean; // If available and enabled
  twofactor: boolean; // For high-security users
}

async function authenticateForSensitiveOp(
  operation: SensitiveOperation,
  userPrefs: UserPreferences
): Promise<boolean> {
  // Respect user's authentication preferences
  const method = selectAuthMethod(userPrefs.auth);
  
  // Explain why authentication is needed
  await partnership.explain(
    `I need to verify it's really you before ${operation.description}`
  );
  
  // Perform authentication
  const authenticated = await performAuth(method);
  
  // Audit trail
  await auditLog.record({
    operation,
    authenticated,
    method,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  return authenticated;
}
```

## 🔍 Security Hardening Options

### For Privacy-Conscious Users

```nix
# configuration.nix
services.nix-for-humanity = {
  enable = true;
  
  privacy = {
    # Disable all learning
    learning.enabled = false;
    
    # Ephemeral mode - no persistence
    persistence.enabled = false;
    
    # Require confirmation for everything
    paranoidMode = true;
    
    # Disable voice entirely
    voice.enabled = false;
  };
  
  security = {
    # Require authentication for all system changes
    alwaysAuthenticate = true;
    
    # Verbose audit logging
    auditLevel = "everything";
    
    # Automatic security updates only
    updates.securityOnly = true;
  };
};
```

### For High-Security Environments

```nix
services.nix-for-humanity = {
  security = {
    # Whitelist only specific operations
    allowedOperations = [
      "query-packages"
      "check-status"
      "view-configuration"
    ];
    
    # Network isolation
    network.isolated = true;
    
    # Read-only mode
    readOnly = true;
    
    # Multi-factor authentication
    auth = {
      require2FA = true;
      provider = "yubikey";
    };
  };
};
```

## 📊 Security Metrics & Monitoring

### What We Track (Locally)

```yaml
Security Events:
  - Authentication attempts
  - Privileged operations
  - Failed validations
  - Rollback events
  
Partnership Health:
  - Trust level (user corrections vs acceptances)
  - Safety score (risky vs safe operations)
  - Learning accuracy
  - Privacy preference adherence
```

### Security Alerts

The AI partner will proactively alert you:
- "I noticed 3 failed authentication attempts"
- "This operation seems unusual for you"
- "Would you like me to explain what this command will do?"
- "I'm not confident about this - please verify"

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```
   "Stop what you're doing"
   "Cancel all operations"
   "Enter safe mode"
   ```

2. **Investigation**
   ```
   "Show me the last 10 operations"
   "What did you just do?"
   "Show me the audit log"
   ```

3. **Recovery**
   ```
   "Rollback the last change"
   "Restore from yesterday"
   "Reset to factory defaults"
   ```
