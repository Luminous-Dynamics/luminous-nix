# 🎯 Nix for Humanity: Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Nix for Humanity transforms NixOS from command-line complexity to natural conversation. Users speak or type naturally, and the system learns, adapts, and eventually transcends itself.

**Budget**: $200/month (Claude Code Max)  
**Timeline**: 3 months to adaptive MVP  
**Status**: Foundation Phase Complete (50+ commands implemented)  
**Architecture**: Tauri desktop app with adaptive visual presence and personality

## 🌟 Vision Statement

> "Making NixOS accessible to every human through natural conversation that adapts to YOUR style."

The system evolves through three stages:
- **Sanctuary**: Rich visual guidance for new users
- **Gymnasium**: Adaptive learning with the user  
- **Open Sky**: Invisible excellence through mastery

7. Document the journey

## 💫 Remember Always

We are building technology that adapts to people, not the other way around. The ultimate success is when someone forgets they're using an interface at all - when the conversation with their computer becomes as natural as talking to a helpful friend.

**Commitment**: One developer, one AI, infinite possibility  
**Development Philosophy**: "Users first, adaptation follows"  
**Ultimate Goal**: Technology that transcends itself

*"The best interface is no interface. The best assistant is one that speaks your language. The path appears by walking, then disappears when mastery is complete."*
