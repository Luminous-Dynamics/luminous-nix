## How These Personas Drive Development

### Every Feature Must Work For All 10
Before shipping any feature, we ask:
- Can Grandma Rose use this with voice?
- Is this fast enough for Maya?
- Will this stress David?
- Is this efficient for Dr. Sarah?
- Can Alex access this fully?
- Will Carlos find this encouraging?
- Can Priya use this while distracted?
- Is this transparent enough for Jamie?
- Will Viktor understand this?
- Is this predictable for Luna?

### Design Tensions Create Excellence
- **Simple enough for Rose** ↔️ **Powerful enough for Alex**
- **Fast for Maya** ↔️ **Patient for Carlos**
- **Clear for Viktor** ↔️ **Efficient for Sarah**
- **Predictable for Luna** ↔️ **Adaptive for others**

### Testing Protocol

1. **Task Success**: Can they complete their primary tasks?
2. **Style Match**: Does the system adapt appropriately?
3. **Stress Testing**: How do they handle errors?
4. **Learning Curve**: How quickly do they improve?
5. **Satisfaction**: Would they recommend it?
