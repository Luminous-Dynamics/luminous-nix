# 📊 Project Status - Nix for Humanity

*Last Updated: 2025-07-25*

## Executive Summary

Nix for Humanity is in **active development** with core design complete and implementation underway. We've successfully pivoted from a GUI concept to a natural language interface with supportive visual elements.

## Overall Progress: ~35% Complete

### ✅ What's Done (90-100%)
- **Vision & Philosophy** - Clear, documented, and unified
- **Architecture Design** - Hybrid NLP approach defined
- **Development Philosophy** - $200/month model proven
- **Documentation Structure** - Organized and accessible
- **Security Framework** - Designed (not implemented)
- **Accessibility Standards** - WCAG AAA targeted

### 🚧 In Progress (20-70%)
- **NLP Implementation** (60%) - Intent patterns defined, integration needed
- **Tauri Desktop App** (40%) - Structure ready, needs NLP connection
- **Error Recovery** (30%) - Philosophy documented, implementation pending
- **Learning System** (20%) - Designed but not built
- **Command Coverage** (30%) - Basic commands planned

### ❌ Not Started (0%)
- **Voice Integration** - Whisper.cpp planned
- **User Testing** - No real users yet
- **Distribution** - Flake structure only
- **Community Building** - No Discord/forum yet
- **Production Deployment** - Local development only

## Technical Status

### Core Components
| Component | Design | Implementation | Testing | Documentation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| NLP Engine | ✅ 100% | 🚧 60% | ❌ 10% | ✅ 90% |
| Tauri App | ✅ 100% | 🚧 40% | ❌ 5% | ✅ 80% |

| Learning System | ✅ 90% | ❌ 0% | ❌ 0% | ✅ 80% |
| Voice Interface | ✅ 80% | ❌ 0% | ❌ 0% | 🚧 60% |

### Feature Coverage
- **Package Management**: 10/50 commands designed
- **System Configuration**: 5/30 commands designed
- **Troubleshooting**: 3/20 patterns designed
- **User Management**: 0/10 commands designed
- **Network Management**: 2/15 commands designed

## Recent Achievements (Past Week)

1. ✅ Clarified vision: Natural language with supportive visuals
2. ✅ Restored valuable documentation from archives
3. ✅ Created unified vision document (VISION_2025.md)
4. ✅ Organized documentation structure
5. ✅ Established Layered Reality approach (no simulation)

## Current Sprint Focus

### Week of July 22-28, 2025
1. 🎯 Remove remaining GUI terminology
2. 🎯 Connect NLP to Tauri for real commands
3. 🎯 Test 5 basic commands end-to-end
4. 🎯 Create demo video
5. 🎯 Update all completion claims

## Blockers & Risks

### Technical Blockers
- **NLP-Tauri Integration** - IPC bridge needs implementation
- **Command Sandboxing** - Security layer not built
- **Dynamic Timeouts** - Critical for user experience

### Project Risks
- **No User Testing** - Building without feedback
- **Documentation Debt** - Still some inconsistencies
- **Single Developer** - Bus factor of 1

## Resource Status

### Budget
- **Monthly**: $200 (Claude Code Max subscription)
- **Spent to Date**: ~$600 (3 months)
- **Runway**: Indefinite (personal project)

### Time Investment
- **Hours/Week**: 20-30
- **Total Hours**: ~240
- **Efficiency**: High (AI-assisted development)

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: ~10% (needs improvement)
- **Documentation**: 85% (good)
- **Type Safety**: 90% (TypeScript)
- **Accessibility**: Design complete, implementation pending

### Development Velocity
- **Features/Week**: 3-5
- **Bugs/Week**: 2-3
- **Documentation/Week**: 10+ pages

## Roadmap Alignment

### Q3 2025 (Current)
- ✅ Vision clarification
- 🚧 Alpha implementation
- ⏳ Basic NLP working
- ⏳ 50 commands supported

### Q4 2025
- ⏳ Beta release
- ⏳ Voice integration
- ⏳ Learning system active
- ⏳ Community launch

### Q1 2026
- ⏳ Production release
- ⏳ 100+ commands
- ⏳ Plugin ecosystem
- ⏳ Multi-language support

## Call to Action

### For Contributors
- We need NLP implementation help
- Security review needed
- Accessibility testing wanted

### For Users
- Alpha testing starts August 2025
- Join waitlist (coming soon)
- Share your NixOS pain points

### For Supporters
- Star on GitHub
- Share the vision
- Provide feedback

## Success Metrics

### What We Measure
- ✅ Can users express intent naturally? (Design: Yes)
- ⏳ Does the system understand? (Partial)
- ❌ Can it execute commands? (Not yet)
- ❌ Does it learn patterns? (Not implemented)
- ✅ Is it accessible? (Design: Yes)

### What Success Looks Like
When a non-technical user can say "install firefox" and it just works, with appropriate visual feedback and no terminal knowledge required.

## Honest Assessment

**The Good:**
- Vision is crystal clear
- Architecture is sound
- Documentation is strong
- Philosophy resonates

**The Challenging:**
- Implementation is behind design
- No real users yet
- Single developer bottleneck
- Integration complexity

**The Path Forward:**
Focus on getting ONE command working end-to-end through the natural language pipeline. Once we prove the concept, momentum will build.
