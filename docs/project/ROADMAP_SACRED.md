# 🕉️ Nix for Humanity: Sacred Development Perspective (Optional)

> "For those who resonate with viewing technology development as a sacred practice, this document offers a consciousness-first lens on the development process."

## Note on Sacred Language

This document uses sacred/spiritual language as an OPTIONAL perspective. The main ROADMAP.md provides the practical development path. This perspective is for those who find meaning in:
- Viewing code as a mindful practice
- Considering user wellbeing as sacred
- Approaching development with reverence
- Finding deeper meaning in technical work

If this language doesn't resonate with you, please use ROADMAP.md for the straightforward technical approach.

## Executive Summary (Sacred Lens)

Nix for Humanity can be viewed as birthing a consciousness partnership that makes NixOS accessible through natural conversation. The system can include mantras, blessings, and sacred language for users who appreciate this approach - but it's completely optional.
