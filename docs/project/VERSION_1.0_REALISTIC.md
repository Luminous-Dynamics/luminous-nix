# Version 1.0 - Realistic Natural Language Interface (6 Months)

*Building on the MVP with genuine utility*

## Core Features

### Expanded Natural Language Understanding
- 50+ command patterns with variations
- Context awareness ("install that", "the same")
- Typo tolerance and fuzzy matching
- Multi-step operations

### Tauri Desktop Application
- Native desktop experience
- System tray integration
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Local storage of preferences

### Voice Input (Basic)
- Whisper.cpp integration
- Push-to-talk interface
- Basic command recognition
- Text fallback always available

### Learning System (Simple)
- Remember user's package preferences
- Track common commands
- Suggest based on history
- All data local

### Example Interactions
```
User: "I need something to edit photos"
System: "I found GIMP and Krita. GIMP is more like Photoshop. Which would you prefer?"

User: "My wifi stopped working"
System: "I'll help diagnose. Running: nmcli device status... [shows results]"

User: "Install the same editor you installed yesterday"
System: "Installing VSCode (installed yesterday at 2:43 PM)"
```

## Technical Implementation
