## ü§î What is NixOS?

NixOS is a unique Linux distribution that:
- **Never breaks** - You can always roll back changes
- **Reproducible** - Same configuration = same system everywhere
- **Declarative** - Describe what you want, not how to get there

### Traditional Linux vs NixOS

| Traditional Linux | NixOS |
|------------------|--------|
| `apt install firefox` | `ask-nix "install firefox"` |
| Can break on updates | Rollback anytime |
| Hard to replicate | Copy one file to clone |
| Manual configuration | Declare and done |

### Why Luminous Nix?

Instead of learning complex Nix syntax:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ firefox vim git ];
```

Just say what you want:
```bash
ask-nix "install firefox, vim, and git"
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Luminous Nix

```bash
# One command installation
curl -sSL https://luminous-nix.dev/install.sh | bash

```

### Step 2: Test Installation

```bash
# Check it works
ask-nix --help

# See version
ask-nix --version
```

### Step 3: Set Your Preference

```bash

# Real mode (actually make changes)
ask-nix settings set dry-run false
```

ask-nix "enable bluetooth"
```

### User Management

```bash
# Add user
ask-nix "create user alice"

## üåà Using the TUI (Terminal UI)

For a visual interface, use the TUI:

```bash
# Launch TUI
nix-tui
```

### TUI Features

- **Tab 1: Terminal** - Run commands with visual feedback
- **Tab 2: Search** - Live package search
- **Tab 3: History** - See all your commands
- **Tab 4: Generations** - Manage system snapshots
- **Tab 5: Settings** - Configure Luminous Nix
- **Tab 6: Status** - System monitoring

### TUI Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F1` | Help |
| `F2` | Toggle dry-run |
| `Tab` | Switch tabs |
| `‚Üë/‚Üì` | Navigate history |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

## üìù Example Workflows

### Setting Up a New System

```bash
# 1. Update system
ask-nix "update everything"

# 2. Install essential packages
ask-nix "install firefox, terminal, text editor, and file manager"

# 3. Set up development tools
ask-nix "install git, make, gcc, and python"

# 4. Configure git
ask-nix "set up git with name 'John Doe' and email 'john@example.com'"

# 5. Enable useful services
ask-nix "enable ssh and firewall"
```

### Daily Usage

```bash
# Morning: Check for updates
ask-nix "any updates today?"

# Install new tool you heard about
ask-nix "install ripgrep"

# Afternoon: Need a tool but don't know the name
ask-nix "I need something to download youtube videos"
# Suggests: youtube-dl, yt-dlp

# Evening: Clean up
ask-nix "clean up old stuff"
```

### Experimenting Safely

```bash
# Try something new (safe mode)
ask-nix --dry-run "install experimental-package"

# If it looks good, do it for real
ask-nix "install experimental-package"

# If it causes problems
ask-nix "rollback"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Use Natural Language
Don't think about package names, just describe what you need:
- ‚ùå `ask-nix "install rxvt-unicode"`
- ‚úÖ `ask-nix "I need a lightweight terminal"`

### 2. Start in Dry-Run Mode
Always preview changes first:
```bash
ask-nix --dry-run "big system change"
```

### 3. Use Generations Liberally
Before big changes:
```bash
ask-nix "create a checkpoint"  # Creates new generation
ask-nix "try something risky"
ask-nix "rollback if needed"
```

### 4. Learn from Luminous Nix
```bash
# See what command would run
ask-nix --show-command "install firefox"

# Understand NixOS better
ask-nix --explain "what are derivations?"
```

```bash
ask-nix --show-nix "install firefox"
# Shows: environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ firefox ];
```

### Q: Can I use regular Linux commands?
**A:** Yes! NixOS is still Linux:
```bash
ls, cd, grep, etc.  # All work normally
```
