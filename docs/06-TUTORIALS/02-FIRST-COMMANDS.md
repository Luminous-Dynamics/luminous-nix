# üó£Ô∏è Nix for Humanity - User Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you use Nix for Humanity to manage your NixOS system through natural conversation. Just say what you want - no commands to memorize!

## üåü What is Nix for Humanity?

Nix for Humanity transforms NixOS from a command-line system into a conversational partner. Instead of typing complex commands, you simply talk to your computer naturally - through voice or text.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### First Time Setup

When you first start Nix for Humanity:

```
System: "Hi! I'm Nix for Humanity. I'll help you manage your computer using natural conversation. What would you like to do?"

You: "Hi! Can you help me install a web browser?"

System: "Of course! I can install Firefox, Chrome, or Brave. Which would you prefer?"

You: "Firefox please"

System: "Installing Firefox web browser... Done! You'll find it in your applications menu. Would you like me to open it now?"
```

### Launch Options

1. **Voice Mode** (Recommended)
   - Say "Hey Nix" to activate
   - Speak naturally after the listening tone
   - No special commands needed

2. **Text Mode**
   ```bash
   nix-for-humanity
   ```
   Or click the icon in your applications menu

3. **Hybrid Mode**
   - Mix voice, text, and clicks as feels natural
   - System adapts to your preferred style

### Set Your Comfort Level

- **Beginner** - Simple language, more guidance, confirmations for everything
- **Intermediate** - Balanced assistance, learns your patterns quickly
- **Advanced** - Minimal interface, quick actions, assumes expertise

### Your First Commands

Try these natural phrases to get started:

```
You: "What can you do?"
Nix: Shows available capabilities with examples

You: "Show me what's installed"
Nix: Lists your installed programs in categories

You: "I need a web browser"
Nix: Suggests browsers and installs your choice

You: "My WiFi isn't working"
Nix: Runs diagnostics and guides you through fixes
```

## üß† How It Learns Your Preferences

### Installation Method Learning

The system notices HOW you like to install packages:

```bash
# First few times, it asks:
You: "install emacs"
Nix: "How would you like to install this?
     1. Add to configuration.nix (system-wide, declarative)
     2. Add to home.nix (user-specific, declarative)
     3. Quick install with nix-env (imperative)
     4. Temporary with nix-shell (testing)"

# After learning your pattern:
You: "install emacs"
Nix: "Adding Emacs to your configuration.nix (your usual method)"
```

### Timing Intelligence

The system learns WHEN you prefer to do things:

```bash
# Friday afternoon:
You: "update system"
Nix: "I notice you usually update on weekends. Schedule for tomorrow morning?"

# During work hours:
You: "install zoom"
Nix: "Installing Zoom now (you usually need communication tools immediately)"

# Large download at 2pm:
You: "install android-studio"
Nix: "That's 8GB. Add to tonight's maintenance window (10pm)?"
```

### Context Understanding

The system learns WHAT you really want:

```bash
# Learns your stack preferences:
You: "install python"
Nix: "Installing Python with pip, jupyter, and pandas (your usual data science setup)?"

# Remembers project contexts:
You: "setup web development"
Nix: "Installing your usual: nodejs, npm, yarn, postgresql, nginx?"

# Understands relationships:
You: "remove docker"
Nix: "This will also remove docker-compose and your k8s tools. Continue?"
```

```

### Curious Carlos (19, Wants to Understand)

### Installation Fails
```
You: "Install docker"
