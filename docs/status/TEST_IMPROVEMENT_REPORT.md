- [x] Pattern recognition bug fixed
- [x] Fix verified with comprehensive tests
- [x] Integration tests added
- [x] Test infrastructure improved
- [ ] Coverage at 80% (currently 10%, needs more work)

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Test Collection Errors (50 remaining)
Main issues in:
- Learning system tests
- TUI tests  
- Native backend tests
- Monitoring tests

### Coverage Improvement Needed
Target: 80% overall coverage
Current: 10% overall coverage
Gap: Need to fix remaining test errors and add more tests

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **For v0.1.1 Release**:
   - Focus on the verified pattern fix
   - Include integration tests
   - Document known test issues
   - Set realistic coverage goals for v0.2.0

2. **For Future Iterations**:
   - Fix remaining 50 test collection errors
   - Add more integration tests
   - Achieve 80% coverage target
   - Implement continuous integration

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

✅ Critical "i need firefox" bug verified fixed
✅ Integration tests for CLI added
✅ Test infrastructure significantly improved
⚠️ 80% coverage target not yet achieved (10% current)

---

*The pattern recognition fix is thoroughly tested and ready for v0.1.1 release, despite not reaching the 80% coverage target. The test infrastructure has been significantly improved and provides a solid foundation for future development.*
