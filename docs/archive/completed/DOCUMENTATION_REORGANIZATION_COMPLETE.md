# ✅ Documentation Reorganization Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-25
**Project**: Nix for Humanity

## Summary

Successfully reorganized all documentation from scattered locations into a clean, hierarchical structure under the `/docs` directory.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Created Organized Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Main documentation index
├── CONTRIBUTING.md          # How to contribute
├── guides/                  # User guides and tutorials
├── technical/               # Architecture and technical specs
├── operations/              # Deployment and operational docs
├── project/                 # Project management and planning
├── philosophy/              # Design philosophy and AI ethics
├── security/                # Security documentation
├── reference/               # API and reference materials
├── stories/                 # User stories and examples
├── tutorials/               # Step-by-step tutorials
├── development/             # Developer documentation
├── error-recovery/          # Error handling docs
└── archive/                 # Historical documentation
```

### 2. Moved Files from Root
- Moved QUICKSTART.md, SECURITY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc. to appropriate subdirectories
- Kept standard files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE) in root as per convention
- Created .claude/ directory for Claude-specific context files

### 3. Merged Duplicates
- Combined 3 architecture documents into single comprehensive docs/technical/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Removed redundant files after merging content

### 4. Created Navigation
- Added README.md index file to each directory
- Updated cross-references and links
- Fixed broken paths in documentation

### 5. Organized by Category
- **Guides**: 12+ user-facing how-to documents
- **Technical**: 19+ architecture and implementation docs
- **Operations**: 5+ deployment and maintenance guides
- **Project**: 10+ planning and management docs
- **Philosophy**: 7+ design philosophy documents
- **Archive**: Historical and meta documentation

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Easy Discovery** - Clear categories make finding docs simple
✅ **Better Maintenance** - Obvious where new docs should go
✅ **Clean Git History** - Used git mv to preserve file history
✅ **Improved Navigation** - Index files guide users through docs
✅ **Reduced Duplication** - Merged similar documents

## Files Remaining in Root

As per standard conventions, these files remain in the project root:
- README.md - Project introduction
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- LICENSE - License file
- Configuration files (package.json, flake.nix, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Review all internal documentation links
2. Update any CI/CD references to doc paths
3. Add more tutorials as features are developed
4. Regular maintenance to keep docs current
