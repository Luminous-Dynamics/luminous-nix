# 🎯 MVP Action Plan - Node.js/Express Implementation

## Strategic Decision Summary

Based on your excellent strategic analysis, we're proceeding with:
- **MVP (4 weeks)**: Simple Node.js/Express API
- **V1.0 (Later)**: Tauri desktop app (archived for future)
- **Focus**: User-space commands only (no sudo required)

## Week 1: Core Foundation

### 1. Set Up Express API Structure
```
implementations/nodejs-mvp/
├── server.js              # Express server
├── routes/
│   └── nlp.js            # NLP command processing
├── services/
│   ├── intent-engine.js  # Reuse from web-based
│   ├── command-builder.js
│   └── executor.js       # Safe user-space execution
├── storage/
│   └── learning.json     # Simple JSON storage
└── test/
```

### 2. Implement 10 User-Space Commands
Safe commands that don't need sudo:
1. `nix search [package]` - Search for packages
2. `nix-env -q` - List installed packages
3. `nix-env -qa [pattern]` - Query available packages
4. `nix doctor` - Check system health
5. `nix-info` - System information
6. `nix-shell -p [package]` - Temporary package use
7. `nix-channel --list` - List channels
8. `nix why-depends` - Dependency info
9. `nix path-info` - Package info
10. `nix log` - View build logs

### 3. Simple Web Interface
- Single HTML page
- Input field for commands
- Real-time response display
- No complex UI needed

## Week 2: Natural Language Processing

### 1. Expand Intent Recognition
- Multiple phrasings per command
- Typo tolerance
- Context awareness
- Suggestions for unclear input

### 2. Learning System (JSON-based)
```javascript
{
  "userPatterns": {
    "install": ["get", "grab", "i need"],
    "search": ["find", "look for", "where is"]
  },
  "commandHistory": [],
  "preferences": {}
}
```

### 3. Error Recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Suggestions for fixes
- Learn from mistakes

## Week 3: Testing & Polish

### 1. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for each command
- Integration tests
- User acceptance testing
- Performance benchmarks

### 2. Documentation
- Installation guide
- User manual
- API documentation
- Video demo

### 3. Deployment Preparation
- systemd service file
- Installation script
- Configuration options

## Week 4: Release

### 1. Beta Testing
- 5-10 early users
- Gather feedback
- Quick iterations

### 2. Official Release
- GitHub release
- Announcement post
- Community outreach

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** + **Express**
- **SQLite** for learning storage (upgrade from JSON)
- **Commander.js** for CLI parsing
- Existing NLP from web-based implementation

### Frontend
- Simple HTML/CSS/JS
- No framework needed for MVP
- Progressive enhancement

### Development
- **Jest** for testing
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Prettier** for formatting

## Key Decisions

### What We're Building
✅ Natural language interface for safe NixOS commands
✅ Learning system that adapts to user patterns
✅ Web API that could later power Tauri/mobile/CLI
✅ Simple, working prototype in 4 weeks

### What We're NOT Building
❌ Desktop app (saved for V1.0)
❌ System-wide commands (needs Polkit)
❌ Complex UI (keep it simple)
❌ Voice input (saved for later)

## Success Criteria

- 10 commands working reliably
- 90%+ intent recognition accuracy
- <2 second response time
- Runs on Raspberry Pi
- Easy 5-minute installation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create Express project structure
2. Port NLP engine from web-based
3. Implement first 3 commands
4. Create simple test interface
5. Deploy to your NixOS system

## Migration Path to V1.0

The Express API we build will become the backend for:
- Tauri desktop app (V1.0)
- Mobile apps (future)
- CLI tool (future)
- Voice assistants (future)

This ensures our MVP work directly contributes to the long-term vision.
