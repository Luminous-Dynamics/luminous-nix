# ✅ Memory Organization Complete

## What We Did

### 1. Followed Luminous-Dynamics Convention
- Created `.claude/` directory for context files
- Removed duplicate `memory/` directory
- Organized files by purpose

### 2. Created Comprehensive Memory Files

#### In `.claude/` directory:
1. **README.md** - Guide to memory files
2. **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Detailed project state (moved from memory/)
3. **VISION_ALIGNMENT.md** - Core vision and philosophy
4. **NIXOS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md** - NixOS best practices
5. **NLP_INTENT_PATTERNS.md** - Natural language patterns library
6. **TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md** - Architecture decision log
7. **ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Non-negotiable accessibility standards

#### In project root:
- **CLAUDE.md** - Main context file with references to .claude/ files

### 3. Memory File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Current state & quick ref | Every session start |
| VISION_ALIGNMENT.md | Why we're building this | Major decisions |
| NIXOS_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md | How to integrate safely | NixOS operations |
| NLP_INTENT_PATTERNS.md | Language patterns | NLP implementation |
| TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md | Tech choices log | Architecture work |
| ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIREMENTS.md | a11y standards | Any UI work |
