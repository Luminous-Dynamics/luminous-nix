# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

*Common questions about Nix for Humanity*

## General Questions

### What is Nix for Humanity?

Nix for Humanity is a natural language interface for NixOS that lets you manage your system through conversation instead of memorizing commands. You can say things like "install firefox" or "my wifi isn't working" and get helpful, personalized responses.

### How is this different from a traditional GUI?

Rather than clicking through menus, you communicate naturally. The system adapts to how YOU think and speak, not the other way around. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who understands NixOS.

### Do I need to know NixOS commands?

Not at all! That's the whole point. You speak naturally and the system translates to proper NixOS commands for you.

### Is my data private?

Absolutely. Everything runs locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers. You can even run it completely offline.

## Getting Started

### How do I install Nix for Humanity?

Currently, you need to clone the repository and run it from source:

```bash
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/nix-for-humanity
./bin/ask-nix "help"
```

A proper NixOS package is coming soon!

### What can I ask it to do?

- **Install software**: "install firefox", "I need a photo editor"
- **System updates**: "update my system", "upgrade nixos"
- **Troubleshooting**: "my wifi isn't working", "bluetooth problems"
- **Information**: "what packages are installed", "how much disk space"
- **Configuration**: "enable ssh", "set up a firewall"

### Why did it ask for confirmation?

Safety first! The system will always ask before making changes to your system. This prevents accidents and helps you learn what's happening.

### Can I see what command it would run?

Yes! Use the `--show-command` flag:
```bash
ask-nix --show-command "install firefox"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: ask-nix"

Make sure you're in the project directory and use the full path:
```bash
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/nix-for-humanity
./bin/ask-nix "help"
```

### "I don't understand that command"

Try being more specific:
- ‚ùå "fix it" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "fix my wifi connection"
- ‚ùå "install" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "install firefox"
- ‚ùå "broken" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "my audio isn't working"

### It suggests the wrong package

The system is learning! You can correct it:
```
You: install code editor
System: Installing VS Code...
You: no, I meant vim
System: My mistake! Installing Vim instead. I'll remember that.
```

### Commands are running slowly

Try the native Python backend for 10x performance:
```bash
export NIX_HUMANITY_PYTHON_BACKEND=true
```

### Getting permission errors

Some operations require sudo. The system will prompt you when needed:
```bash
sudo ./bin/ask-nix "install firefox system-wide"
```

## For Specific Users

### I'm new to computers (like Grandma Rose)

- Start with simple requests: "install firefox"
- Ask for help anytime: "how do I update?"
- The system uses friendly language by default
- Voice interface is coming soon!

### I have ADHD (like Maya)

- Use minimal mode for faster responses: `ask-nix --minimal`
- System responds in under 2 seconds
- Clear, focused instructions without extra fluff

### I'm blind or use a screen reader (like Alex)

- All responses are screen-reader friendly
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Use `ask-nix --accessible` for optimized output
- No essential information is visual-only

### I'm learning programming (like Carlos)

- Use learning mode: `ask-nix --learning`
- Get step-by-step explanations
- Ask "why?" for deeper understanding
- Practice with guided examples

## Advanced Features

### How do personalities work?

The system automatically adapts to your communication style. You can also manually set:
- `--minimal`: Just the facts
- `--friendly`: Warm and helpful (default)
- `--encouraging`: Extra support for learning
- `--technical`: Detailed technical information

### Can it learn my preferences?

Yes! The learning system (currently in development) will:
- Remember your preferred packages ("editor" ‚Üí "vim")
- Adapt explanations to your level
- Suggest workflows based on your patterns
- All learning stays local on your machine

### What about voice commands?

Voice interface is in active development using the pipecat framework. Coming in the next few months!

### Can I extend it with plugins?

Yes! The plugin system allows you to:
- Add custom commands
- Integrate with other tools
- Customize responses
- Share with the community

## Development & Contributing

### How can I contribute?

- Try it and report issues
- Suggest new features
- Contribute code (Python, TypeScript)
- Help with documentation
- Test with different personas

See the [Contributing Guide](../03-DEVELOPMENT/01-CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### What's the Sacred Trinity development model?

It's our revolutionary approach using:
- Human vision and testing
- Claude Code Max for architecture
- Local LLM for NixOS expertise
- Total cost: $200/month vs $4.2M traditional!

### How do you maintain 95% test coverage?

We test at multiple levels:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for component interaction
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Persona tests for all 10 user types

## Philosophy & Vision

### What is "consciousness-first computing"?

Technology should support human awareness, not fragment it. This means:
- Respecting attention and cognitive rhythms
- Progressive disclosure as mastery grows
- Technology that eventually becomes invisible
- Building trust through vulnerability

### What is "The Disappearing Path"?

Our ultimate goal is to make the system so well-adapted to you that it becomes invisible - like intuition. You gain such mastery that external support becomes unnecessary.

### Why NixOS?

NixOS provides:
- Reproducible system configurations
- Safe rollbacks if anything breaks
- Declarative system management
- The most advanced package manager

## Getting Help

### Where can I get support?

1. Check this FAQ
2. Read the [User Guide](../06-TUTORIALS/USER_GUIDE.md)
3. Try the [Troubleshooting Guide](../04-OPERATIONS/03-TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
4. Open an issue on GitHub

### How do I report bugs?

Use `ask-nix --debug` to get detailed logs, then:
1. Include what you asked
2. What you expected
3. What actually happened
4. Your system info (NixOS version, etc.)

### What if I have an accessibility need not covered?

We're committed to universal access. Please:
