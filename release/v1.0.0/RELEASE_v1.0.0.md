# Luminous Nix v1.0.0: Forged in Fire, Built on Granite

We thought we had 95% test coverage. The truth was 17%.

This discovery could have been devastating. Instead, it became our liberation. 
We stopped everything and asked: "What else are we lying to ourselves about?"

Today, after weeks of Sacred Subtraction‚Äîremoving 51 variant files, 222 outdated 
documents, and every unsubstantiated claim‚Äîwe release v1.0.0.

Not because it's perfect. But because it's honest.

## What This Is

Luminous Nix is a natural language interface for NixOS. Say "install firefox" 
and it works. Built by a solo developer with AI assistance, proving a new way 
of building is possible.

### Core Features
- **Natural Language**: Just speak normally - "install firefox", "search for markdown editor"
- **30-Second Installation**: `curl -sSL luminous.dev/install | bash`
- **Educational Errors**: Every error teaches you something about NixOS
- **Real Coverage**: 65% test coverage, 320+ passing tests (not vanity metrics)
- **Lightning Fast**: Native Python-Nix API eliminates subprocess overhead

## What This Isn't

This isn't "revolutionary" or "game-changing." Those are words for others to 
use if we earn them. This is v1.0.0 - solid, tested, ready. We have 65% real 
test coverage, 320+ passing tests, and a 30-second installer.

## Our Development Model

Luminous Nix was built using a unique, experimental development model we call 
the 'Sacred Trinity'‚Äîa deep, co-creative partnership between a human visionary 
and AI assistants. We believe this new way of building is a core part of our 
'consciousness-first' philosophy. We are still learning, and we invite other 
developers to join us in exploring this new frontier of human-AI collaboration.

## Our Philosophy: The Luminous Way

This project is an experiment in "Consciousness-First Computing." We believe 
technology should serve human well-being, not extract human attention. Our work 
is guided by a simple constitution: we practice Sacred Subtraction to achieve 
Sophisticated Simplicity. We believe the best technology is that which becomes 
an invisible, elegant extension of your own will. This is not just how we build; 
it is our vow to you, our user.

## Installation

```bash
# The 30-second path
curl -sSL luminous.dev/install | bash

# Or via Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.luminous-nix

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-nix
cd luminous-nix
poetry install
```

## Usage

```bash
# Natural language, just like talking
ask-nix "install firefox"
ask-nix "search for video editor"
ask-nix "create python development environment"
ask-nix "update all packages"

# Beautiful TUI (coming in v1.1)
nix-tui

# Voice control (coming in v1.2)
nix-voice
```

## The Story of the 35%

This release embodies a journey of radical honesty:

1. **The Illusion**: We thought we had 95% test coverage
2. **The Truth**: Actual coverage was 17% 
3. **The Choice**: Stop everything and build real foundations
4. **The Work**: Sacred Subtraction - removed 51 variants, 222 outdated docs
5. **The Result**: 65% real coverage, every claim verified

This is our promise: we will always choose truth over marketing, simplicity over 
features, and service over extraction.
